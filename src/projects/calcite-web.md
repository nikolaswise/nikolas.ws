description: A framework that addresses common design problems and interactive elements for Esri, creating a united visual language and user experience. Teams within Esri can now quickly build branded, lightweight, accessible websites. The systemic approach of the framework, along with the development of a robust and central codebase, allows highly focused design interventions for common patterns that are disseminated across all projects. This resource saves time and effort across every team within the company, and stabilizes Esri's brand presence on the web. Calcite Web can also be used as a dependency for creating branded themes for other front end frameworks, like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

What it is:
A sass-based CSS framework that addresses common design problems and interactive elements for Esri.

What it does:
Allows teams within Esri to quickly build branded, lightweight, accessible websites quickly. Creates a united visual language and user experience across a wide range of web products built by teams all over the world.

Why we did it:
Different teams with with different projects had to repeatedly solve the same design problems with the resources at their disposal. This resulted in a wide range of web properties that were all different facets of the same platform that had sometimes radically different design decisions. This project created a baseline for teams to work from.

Why it's interesting:
The systemic approach to a branded visual and information, along with the development of a robust and central codebase, allows highly focused design interventions into common elements and patterns that are then disseminated across the entire web presence of the company. The framework can be used a framework- and project-agnostic dependency and be used to create themes for other projects like Bootstrap.
