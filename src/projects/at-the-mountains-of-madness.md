description: An exercise in digital publishing, this edition of _At the Mountains of Madness_ by H.P. Lovecraft is a free, open, public domain text. Created as a high-end, web-native publication in response to a personal desire the read the text online, and being unable to find a version that did the original physical publication any justice.
