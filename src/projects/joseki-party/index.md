What it is:
A no-auth Go game client that uses Firebase and MVI theories of app design.

What it does:
Allows anyone to quickly set up a game and invite an opponent with a single URL.

Why we did it:
[Paul](http://paulcpederson.com/) play Go every day at lunch. Once, when I was working from the studio, we wanted to play online. After much hunting and exploring, we discovered there was no way to play by just sending a link and going from there. So we decided to do it ourselves.

Why it’s interesting:
Its a No-auth web app, a component driven app with no framework, and an exploration of designs that abandon the usual visual language of the game.
