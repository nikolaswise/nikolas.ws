description: Terraformer is a geospatial data manipulation library written mostly by <a href="https://github.com/JerrySievert">Jerry Sievert</a> and <a href="https://github.com/patrickarlt">Patrick Arlt</a>. I created a small brand to go along with the documentation. The project was so appreciated by a certain set that one fan presented us with a mason jar of Terraformer Brand Moonshine.
