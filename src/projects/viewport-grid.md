description: A view port based CSS grid system that defines column widths as a set percentage of the screen rather the width of a container. Viewport Grid puts less columns on small screen, and more columns on large screens. A column becomes a standard unit of measurement, creating a constant and abstracted grid system that stands behind the content of a page rather than within it.
