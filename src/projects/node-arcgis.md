description: Esri product developers around the globe were recreating the same solutions to common problems in the context of their applications. Node ArcGIS reduces duplicated code and allows a greater sharing of time and resources across teams, and opens solutions to the open-source community. Node ArcGIS is an API that adheres to contemporary specs, acting a buffer between NodeJS workflows and the older, highly stable, [ArcGIS REST API](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest). Node ArcGIS brings the power of the ArcGIS platform to the largest and fastest growing language and package manager - [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arcgis).

What it is:
A Node.js client library for the ArcGIS platform.

What it does:
Creates a centralized code base for common platform interactions, reducing duplicated code and allowing a great sharing of time and resources across different development teams. This lets JavScript developers across the entire company work more efficiently, and brings the power of the ArcGIS platform to the largest and fastest growing language and package manager - Node JS and NPM.

Why we did it:
Esri product developers around the globe where each individually recreating the same solutions to common problems, but only in the context of their specific applications. We set out to coordinate and consolidate these efforts in a generalized, powerful, and meaningful way.

Why it's interesting:
The project allows for developers on widely different projects and teams work together to solve common problems, and opens those solutions to the broader open-source community. Node ArcGIS is also a fast-moving, agile API front that adheres to contemporary API specs, acting a buffer between what Node developers expect from an API and the older, stable, but slow-moving ArcGIS REST API.
