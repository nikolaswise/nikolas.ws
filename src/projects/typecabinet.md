description: Typecabinet is set of CSS and Sass tools for managing typographic elements focusing on simplifying typesetting processes. Typecabinet is informed by the classical process of handset type. Vertical rhythm, proportional scales, and a tidy baseline all work together to provide typographic clarity and a clear visual style.
