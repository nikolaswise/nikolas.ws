0. The Problem

the map is itself a miniature that pivots around the body to represent the gigantic enormity of the physical world. the map shifts the scale of the world down to a place it can be held in the hands and entirely seen with the eye. The map connects the vastness of reality to the body in way that can be handled.

This creates tension with maps on the screen - especially the internet. The screen can _not_ be touched, and the internet can not be related to the body. Phones and tablets mitigate this by bringing the screen closer, and moving to the size of the hand, but perhaps the core difficulties remain.

1. What does the map do?

The map provides context for understanding world-scale systems and landscape-scale concepts in a human-scale object. Half way between the book and visual art (both techniques used to provide access to inter-personal ideas beyond the scale of the individual).

2. How does the map do that?

The map is a very specific type of visual design tool with formal qualities that lend themselves to the problem at hand. These formalities are partly defined and structured by the technologies behind the production and distribution of the map.

3. Why are maps good?

What makes a good map a good map? The careful and deliberate application of the maps formal characteristics to solve the problem at hand – specifically through the use and balance of exaggeration and simplification.

4. How did maps get made before the internet?

The first maps where hand drawn, and correspondingly have attributes of other hand-made visual works. With the advent of printing, maps started to be caved into wood, and duplicated. After wood, it came to etching, and after that lithography. In each of the print techniques, certain marks are favored and made possible through the medium of the matrix itself. Shared in all the print techniques, however, id the concept of plates – individual drawn layers for different colors. Equating individual plates to individual colors to individual _typological concepts_ being shown on the map is a big reason why printed maps are so good.
