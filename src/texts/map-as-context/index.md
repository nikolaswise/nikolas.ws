A work in progress to re-write the `Map as Context` research that started the Lower Albina project.

0. The Problem

The map is itself a miniature that pivots around the body to represent the gigantic enormity of the physical world. The map shifts the scale of the world down to a place it can be held in the hands and entirely seen with the eye. The map connects the vastness of reality to the body in way that can be handled.

This creates tension with maps on the screen - especially the internet. The screen can _not_ be touched, and the internet can not be related to the body. Phones and tablets mitigate this by bringing the screen closer, and moving to the size of the hand, but perhaps the core difficulties remain.

1. What does the map do?

The map provides context for understanding world-scale systems and landscape-scale concepts in a human-scale object. Half way between the book and visual art (both techniques used to provide access to inter-personal ideas beyond the scale of the individual).

2. How does the map do that?

The map is a very specific type of visual design tool with formal qualities that lend themselves to the problem at hand. These formalities are partly defined and structured by the technologies behind the production and distribution of the map.

3. Why are maps good?

What makes a good map a good map? The careful and deliberate application of the maps formal characteristics to solve the problem at hand – specifically through the use and balance of exaggeration and simplification.

4. How did maps get made before the internet?

The first maps where hand drawn, and correspondingly have attributes of other hand-made visual works. With the advent of printing, maps started to be caved into wood, and duplicated. After wood, it came to etching, and after that lithography. In each of the print techniques, certain marks are favored and made possible through the medium of the matrix itself. Shared in all the print techniques, however, id the concept of plates – individual drawn layers for different colors. Equating individual plates to individual colors to individual _typological concepts_ being shown on the map is a big reason why printed maps are so good.

5. How do we make maps on the internet?

Exploring theories of Esri, MapBox, CartoDB.

Esri makes maps by through mathematical and analytic tools comparing sets of data, and creating new sets of data to answer questions.

Mapbox makes maps by providing ways to style and add new data to the robust and global open data set.

CartoDB makes maps by allowing the layering and styling of set of data, perhaps closest to the traditional way of making a map with print.

All three techniques utilize a relatively static map that purports to usefully describe the entire geography of the planet. All of the maps made are intended to sit within larger application, itself designed to solve a problem.

6. What are the problems with internet maps?

Internet maps fail to provide meaningful connection to the concepts provided - they lose the essential aspect of the map that join world-to-human scales, instead operating at the world-to-world level. The endless map of the internet is itself incomprehensible to the body. The maps of the internet are simultaneously too broad and too simple, providing too much and too little. The problem the map is presenting itself as a solution too is usually far too muddy, and the resulting lack of clarity of purpose leads to a map with itself a lack of clarity.

7. How can we make good internet maps?

Looking to the main purpose of the map — simplicity, clarity, and the minituarization of the world to pivot around the human hand — while using the formal visual tools and design lessons of the previous several centuries of paper maps – the balance of simplification and exaggeration, clear conceptual separations, and embracing the limitations of the object to provide focus.

In all, the map must be appropriate and natural for it's intended use, playing its role in the overall purpose of the design solution.
