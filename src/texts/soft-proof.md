The soft proof gives you an idea of what a project will look like before it's done — a preview on a screen of an image that will come off a press.


It's necessarily a translation; from this color space to that; one behavior of light to another; approximating the tone of a paper stock.


The current workflow of digital to print is so smooth as to occlude the massive technological feat that supports it; The ubiquity go this process, the decisions of consortium that settled on it. **research here: the history of the current profiles, adobe, apple, etc**


The current, baseline profiles built around RGB and CMYK came about with the rise of digital image-making, which is the basis of the the current world around us, a world built on and predicated by images.


The dominant translation _is_ dominant because it — to a large degree — works. Creating color profile is really hard, mathy, phsysicsy stuff. It's hard to do yourself. But CMYK/RGB cuts the corners off the world to make it fit into a gamut that can be handled. But by necessity it's a compromise: what colors are we not handling in order to handle the maximum number of colors? What parts of the color space get left behind?


Its important to understand this compromise; understand how it works and what exchange we're making in the process. What ae we giving up, and what are we getting in return?


What are we leaving on the table? For example, photography (up instill the 80's **maybe???** calibrated for white people. African Americans and other dark skinned people photographed poorly. They were outside the color space.


How do we understand the implicit, invisible, baked in assumptions of the soft proof?


We can start to operate outside the parameters of the soft proof, recognize it as a tool to use or not use.


The Risograph has a toolchain for soft proofing, but the machine— through its high speed & low cost — also opens up the possibility of designing images through iterative hard proofs; blending the techniques go the modern digital print process with the classical analog ones.


The web is a strange medium – a blending of soft and hard spaces. A plastique space, with plastic proofs and plastic copies. The same process of translation is at work — between the still & the interactive, flowing image.


The gap between the soft proof & the hard copy (or the plastique product) is measured in the gap between the tools used to plan & prepare versus the tools used to produce.


This is why showing comps & wireframes of websites **and screenprints??** to clients can be so tricky: our culture of image cult and tehnological process can elide the critical differences we sense as agents of these systems.


This is a call for a marxism of image making — to seize the means of production. To create radical images & tools that exist in the corners of the gamut and color spaces discarded by the soft proof.
