title: What is Design/Development?

description: Moving beyond the idea that the designer and the developer on a web project are different people, and that somehow those are different things.

For a long time, websites got made with one person designing how it should look and one person developing the code that made it look that way.

A lot times, this is still how things get done - one team makes static Photoshop comps, and hands them off to a team of developers who know stuff like whether React of Ember or Node or Ruby is the best thing, and websites get made. This can sometimes cause friction. The designer expects to the website to look like exactly like the comp, the developer writes a bunch of custom CSS and HTML to fit the design, and whoever needs to make sure the whole thing WCAAG compliant spends a week hating both of them.

This splitting of systems is an artificial one that's sustained by organizational assumptions: we need designers, and we need developers. The thing about Design though - capital D _design_ - is that it's simply a method of creating a structure to accomplish a purpose. The design tools and methods one uses to accomplish good design is always in tune with the thing being made. A building doesn't go from painting to construction drawings, nor does a car go from modeling clay to racetrack. The clay and the paint are very useful steps to _start_ the process of design. They help us to be creative and loose and explore new solutions to the problems at hand. This exploratory work helps us to understand how a thing will _feel_ in the world.

These initial drawings and sketches get translated into their final structures, and translation is a process can enrich both what is being translated _to_ as well as what is being translated _from_.

We turn our drawings into objects with all the considerations of the final materiality present. A new design for a car can't ignore the shape of the engine. A building can't ignore structural code requirements. Design is provisional until the point it exists in the world, and when talking about the web even this isn't any sort of ending. A website is it's own sort of thing, with its own structure and requirements that need to be present and known throughout the entire process of design.

A drawing and a website will never looks the same. This is mostly because a website doesn't have one way that it looks. Because of this, what a website _looks like_ is just a small piece of what a website _is_. The best way to meet our goals as people who make good websites is to focus less on those drawings right away. Instead we think more about simplicity and elegance rather than get caught up in the detail oriented perfection a jpeg.

Don't get me wrong - the jpeg can be important. It shows us how we think we can solve our problems, it shows us a glimpse of how we want our website to looks and feel, the tone we want to communicate. Through all this it needs to have to room to change and breath as it comes to life and becomes a real thing. Our drawings should not be on the level of "what does this look like" but "what problem does this solve and how". At every step in the process we can work to make the real thing better, to solve new questions that arise as we move through the process of design / development â€“ a process where there is no gap between those two ideas.

To design a website is to develop it - and as we develop a website we are constantly making design decisions. A designer cannot abdicate their responsibility to design by saying "well, my jpeg looked great." A developer cannot abdicate their responsibility to a codebase by saying "well that's what they wanted in the comp."

Design / development is making a drawing of a thing you want, than making it a real thing.
