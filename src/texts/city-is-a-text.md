description: Eco's examination of referencing original - or authentic - identities applied to the character of the city. How does a city remain authentic?

If you live in Portland — like I happen to — you may have noticed something strange in the past few years. It's not a story that's particularly unique to Portland, and has played itself out in a lot of places, over and over again. San Francisco has lived through many iterations of this.

Over the past 10 years, Portland's population has grown 20%, from 500 thousand to over 600 thousand people^[Talk about these numbers also more research]. The metro area has seen similar growth, growing by about 400,000 more people^[Thee are numbers that need to be backed up]. Combine this growing population with our urban growth boundary^[The Urban Growth boundary was established in the 70's the prevent urban sprawl and protect the farmland and wilderness around Portland. All in all, I think it's a pretty great thing with some unfortunate side effects.]. This means more density, higher costs of living, and more valuable real estate. Today in Portland, things are far more expensive than they've ever been – even though costs are still far behind other major West Coast cities.

What this mostly means on the ground here is that things are changing. What was once a Hostess factory producing untold numbers of Twinkies is now an upscale supermarket. The empty lots and small houses surrounding it have been torn up and replaced with 6 to 8 story apartment complexes. People like me who grew up here go around saying "Portland isn't even the same _place_ any more!" Someone like me may feel that the current incarnation of the city isn't the "authentic" Old Portland, and my idea of the Old Portland is not the "authentic" Portland of Gus Van Sant and the 70's and 80's (skinheads included).

The geographer <a href="">Richard Campanella</a> talks about this effect of authenticity as it relates to Bourbon Street in New Orleans in an article in Places Journal titled <a href="https://placesjournal.org/article/hating-bourbon-street/">Hating on Bourbon Street.</a> Campanella concludes that Bourbon Street is still an _authentic place_, but from the perspective of Bourbon Street, if not fans of _Easy Rider_.

Umberto Eco also spends some time thinking about and exploring the idea of the authentic. In _Kant and the Platypus_, Eco uses the story of the Swedish ship the _Vasa_ (his retelling of the Ship of Theseus) to explore and create a framework for investigating authenticity. In this exercise, Eco contrasts the _Vasa_ currently in a museum — a ship that sank pretty much immediately after completion — to a hypothetical _Vasa_ that served it's roll in the fleet for many years, eventually having nearly every timber in the ship replaced as repairs and upgrades occur. Eco than asks 'which ship is more authentic?'

Within his framework, Eco notes that there are three requisites to authenticity:

1. Gradual Continuity
2. Uninterrupted Legal Recognition
3. Form

In both cases, each _Vasa_ would have to be regarded as authentic. However, it's noted that the _Vasa_ that has been repaired and upgraded over the past 100 years is not 'authentic' from the perspective of the archaeologist, and the _Vasa_ sitting in the museum ... what was the counter point here? ...  A conclusion is reached which parallels that of Campanella — authentic for whom? Authenticity is established through the combination of expectation and the focal point which is being examined. As objects contain a multitude of properties, each therefor contains multiple 'venues of authenticity'. Authenticity is a contemporary, subjective judgment rather than usual assumption of an objective, historical quality of honesty.

All cities change through time. The current round of development in Portland, as much as long-time locals decry the lack of authenticity, is clearly grounded within all three of Eco's requisites. The gradual continuity of the city stretches back to founding and naming of the place, the history of the place at the confluence of the Willamette and the Columbia. The story of each individual building may be sudden, the continuity of the _City_ is clearly gradual. The interconnected movement of hundreds of thousands of individual actions, all taken at the pace of human activity, creates the gradual shift of Portland Then to Portland Now.

The form of the city, too, remains stable. The topography of the land changes slightly with time, the plans and borders my shift and move, but at a very fundamental level, Mount Tabor is still the same place, the main thoroughfares are recognizable, and the feel and flow of the city would doubtless be recognized through any period of time. Even cities that have had a great disaster or uprooting — San Francisco after the Great Earthquake and subsequent fire, Paris during Hausmann's bulldozing phase — maintain a recognizable form.

As for uninterrupted legal recognition, that is the fundamental kernel of what a city _is_. A city is defined, created, and managed by the legal structures that inhabit it, much like a bureaucratic mollusk. Portland has been a unique and stable legal entity for it's entire existence.

Clearly than, to acknowledge the authenticity of Portland from Eco's framework is to combine that knowledge with the Companella's conclusion regarding Bourbon Street; Portland is authentic _to itself_.

Fictional places, the fictionalized 'West', the China as shown through the Chinatown, etc. are standard understandings of a fictionalized place.
