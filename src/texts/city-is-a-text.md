description: Eco's examination of referencing original - or authentic - identities applied to the character of the city. How does a city remain authentic?

If you live in Portland — like I happen to — you may have noticed something strange in the past few years. It's not a story that's particularly unique to Portland, and has played itself out in a lot of places, over and over again. San Francisco has lived through many iterations of this. Over the past 10 years, Portland's population has grown 20%, from 500 thousand to over 600 thousand people^[Talk about these numbes also more research]. The metro area has seen similat growth, growing by about 400,000 more people^[Thee are numbers that need to be backed up]. Combine this growing population with our urban growth boundary^[The Urban Gowth boundary was estabalished in the 70's the prevent urban sprawl and protect the farmland and wilderness around Portland. All in all, I think it's a pretty great thing with some unfortunate side effects.]. All in all, this means more density, higher costs of living, and more valuable real estate. Today in Portland, things are far more expensive than they've ever been – even though costs are still far behind other major West Coast cities.

What this mostly means on the ground here is that things are changing. What was once a Hostess factory producing untold numbers of Twinkies is now an upscale supermarket. The empty lots and small houses surrounding it have been torn up and replaced with 6 to 8 story apartment complexes. People like me who grew up here go around saying "Portland isn't even the same _place_ any more!" Someone like me may feel that the current incarnation of the city isn't the "authentic" Old Portland, and my idea of the Old Portland is not the "authentic" Portland of Gus Van Sant and the 70's and 80's (skinheads included).

In Umberto Eco's _Kant and the Platypus_, Eco uses the story of the Swedish ship the _Vasa_ as a way to explore the paradox of the Ship of Theseus.

Eco notes that there are three requisites to authenticity:

1. Gradual Continuity
2. Uninterrupted Legal Recognition
3. Form
Super rough, need to get the Eco text in here to work from.

#### Outline

- Quote from Eco, his writing that examine authenticity through perspective and language.

- Draw parallels with the individuals experience of the city.

- Notes and examples from the current urban development processes in Portland.
