<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>With this project, I was attempting to create a centralized code base for common platform interactions â€” reducing duplicated code and allowing a greater sharing of resources across different development teams at Esri.</p>
<p>Esri product developers around the globe were recreating the same solutions to common problems in the context of their applications. Node ArcGIS reduces duplicated code and allows a greater sharing of time and resources across teams, and opens solutions to the open-source community. Node ArcGIS is an API that adheres to contemporary specs, acting a buffer between NodeJS workflows and the older, highly stable, <a

>ArcGIS REST API</a>. Node ArcGIS brings the power of the ArcGIS platform to the largest and fastest growing language and package manager - <a
  href="https://nodejs.org/en/"
  rel="nofollow"
>Node JS</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/arcgis" rel="nofollow">NPM</a>.</p>

></p>
<p>The project allows for developers on widely different projects and teams work together to solve common problems, and opens those solutions to the broader open-source community. Node ArcGIS is also a fast-moving, agile API front that adheres to contemporary API specs, acting a buffer between what Node developers expect from an API and the older, stable, but slow-moving ArcGIS REST API.</p>
