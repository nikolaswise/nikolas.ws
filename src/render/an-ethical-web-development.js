In Portland, antifa is in the street in running battles with secret police, exploited workers are speaking up about the realities of our treasured restaurant industry, business owners are shutting down and pulling a disappearing act instead of facing accountability for their behavior. This has me thinking about <em>my</em> industry, which we all know has massive problems around racism, techno-fascism, and robber-baron level exploitation. We’re still dealing with people who read <em>Snow Crash</em> and <em>Neuromancer</em> and think those books were descriptions of Utopias.`;

This is all good and necessary work. It makes me think though, about if there are distinctions between the craft and practice of web development and the business logic and drive the industry. The industry vs the practice - as in the technical skill of painting vs the economic system of patronage. Clearly they are related, and clearly our conception of painting has always been tied to the economic structures that make it a reality as a profession, but is there a way to think about an Ethical Web Development? It would be tied to running an ethical business, and necessarily need to be supporting by an ethical economic system, but how could we articulate what it would look like the perform the craft and practice of web development ethically? What would an antiracist and antifascist web development practice look like?s";

So I asked him if there were any frameworks for determining if a given industry (his discipline focuses on forestry and resource management for example) was acting “ethically”. How does an industry set its own standard of ethical behavior? He explained that acting “ethically” is essentially just staying internally consistent to a set of values that you’ve articulated — and in this way being “ethical” or “sustainable” doesn’t inherently hold any value. Many people or entities agree on the importance of acting ethically, but their baseline for what the core concepts actually mean, what they are talking about when they mean “harm” for example can vary wildly.`;

			p3.textContent = "An ethical framework is a tool to reduce the possibility space - to help determine what choices available should be taken rather than could be taken. It creates a heuristic for determining which actions will cultivate an environment that supports a set of desired values. Determining ethical considerations becomes a design problem — what values do we want to see in the world? What outcomes do we want and why? Who are we considering, who are we not considering? What are the edges and the limitations beyond which we decide not to concern ourselves?";

If we assume that a utilitarian, individualist ethic is the <em>only</em> possible ethic we can work with (cough cough economics cough cough) it will necessarily preclude a whole range of outcomes that just aren’t possible to arrive at from those starting conditions. Another ethic based on compassion, animism, and collectivism would start with wildly different axioms and naturally arrive at different outcomes. This debate and tension is at play <em>today</em> among the people who study and try and outline what a sustainable future of forest management is - it’s an ongoing conversation (argument?) between people who don’t share the same basic axioms around what they are trying to talk about.`;
			t21 = space();
			p5 = element("p");
			p5.textContent = "Perhaps the core of any ethic is “harm reduction”. We can see this in the Hippocratic oath and the medical ethic — first do no harm. The issue is that “harm” is not a natural, discoverable property of the natural world. Harm is necessarily framed as a value judgment, the corollary to the idea of “good in the expanded field”. We can outline the structural requirements and definitions of harm, and use those value judgments to identify harm in the world, but it’s still a human judgement system being used to sort and order the world. The medical world to illustrate this, we can look at the contemporary prerogative of “informed consent”. We now define lack agency over medical decisions as a harm done to an individual. This has not always been the case.";

			p6.innerHTML = `This starts to get at the ecological connections between the craft and the business and web development - we can easily frame accessibility as a fundamental requirement of an ethical web development practice in that it reduces the harm of excluding individuals from our work. But we can arrive at that principle from the logic of many different ethics, some of which could be wildly contradictory. From a utilitarian, efficiency and profit maximizing ethic, creating accessible web apps is ethical because not doing so would be to leave money on the table. From a humanistic and compassionate ethic, it’s accessible because it fosters inclusion and equity. So we see accessibility and a clearly defined ethical practice, but that doesn’t mean that we all agree on <em>why</em> accessibility is ethical.`;

This is striking. We live in a time of unprecedented efficiency, unbelievable abundance, and massive wealth but if a <em>restaurant</em> is called to truly account for its exploitation to charge its true price, it’s immediately untenable. This feels like it must be true across many industries – Uber would rather cease service in California than treat it’s drivers like employees.

Not only the price attached to it (steep, for nice paper) but also the work and craft that went in to making it. One had to be sure that the image we we’re impressing on the blank sheet of paper added value to it that than reduced it. Our work had to be more valuable than the paper, and if it wasn’t we didn’t make it.";
