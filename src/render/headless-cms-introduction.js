In these sorts of projects the content management system <em>is</em> the codebase, and the strategy for managing content is identical to the process for managing code. This, obviously, is not ideal for anyone who wants to edit content and not code, or in uncomfortable in the workflows that developers rely on for our day-to-day practice — like Git. The other end of the spectrum of CMS is something like Squarespace — the code is the content. Not ideal if you want to edit code and not content. A traditional CMS like Wordpress attempts to split the difference; the CMS controls the code and the content, but makes an attempt to keep them at least a little independant by storage content in a database and providing an admin interface for editing and authoring that content.`;

Both parts are coupled together, with the CMS rendering the “head” of the website or app.";

			p2 = element("p");
			p2.textContent = "In the past few years with rise of build-time generated and static sites, a new approach to this problem has been articulated and built by a number of companies. The basic idea underlying this new approach is that the CMS should only be in charge of content, and interacted with like any other API. This decouples the code from the content, and removes the CMS from any responsibility of interacting with the code at all. This style of CMS does not render anything out to the web, and is thus called a headless CMS. In short, a headless CMS has no website out of the box. This means there is not a default theme (there are no themes!) to configure, there is no classic “blog” visuals or interfaces to configure and map too content. A blog is just one of many things a headless CMS can be used for.";

The second biggest advantage is it provides the development team with complete freedom to meet the real-world business use cases associated with the project without relying on the CMS to support those use cases.";

SEO tags and page metadata can become content like any other content, and the codebase of the web app is responsible for rendering the actual website as it goes over the wire and gets consumed by browsers. Instead of relying on Wordpress Plugins or trusting that Squarespace is following best practices, all of the implementation details over your SEO strategy is completely in your teams control — just like any project <em>without</em> a CMS integration — while the content itself is entirely in your strategy or marketing teams control.`;
