Node ArcGIS reduces duplicated code and allows a greater sharing of time and resources across teams, and opens solutions to the open-source community. Node ArcGIS is an API that adheres to contemporary specs, acting a buffer between NodeJS workflows and the older, highly stable, <a href=\"https://developers.arcgis.com/rest\">ArcGIS REST API</a>. Node ArcGIS brings the power of the ArcGIS platform to the largest and fastest growing language and package manager - <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node JS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/arcgis\">NPM</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Node-arcgis/i-kJnNcvC/0/1e471604/X3/docs-X3.png\" alt=\"Node Arcgis Documentation\"></p>\n<p>The project allows for developers on widely different projects and teams work together to solve common problems, and opens those solutions to the broader open-source community. Node ArcGIS is also a fast-moving, agile API front that adheres to contemporary API specs, acting a buffer between what Node developers expect from an API and the older, stable, but slow-moving ArcGIS REST API.</p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"/texts/building-a-client-library/\">in-depth introduction to the project with code samples</a> for a a full run-down of what designing a project like this is all about.</p>\n<h2>Update from 2018</h2>\n<p>Two of my favorite developers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/geogangster\">John Gravois</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickarlt\">Patrick Arlt</a>, took this idea all the way home with their excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-rest-js\">ArcGIS REST JS</a> project!</p>\n"}}
