This im­plies that be­hav­ing dif­fer­ently in an or­ga­ni­za­tion is enough to the change the out­comes of that or­ga­ni­za­tion. This is ﬂatly un­true - in­di­vid­u­als have lit­tle to no abil­ity to change the out­comes of struc­tural and or­ga­ni­za­tional de­ci­sions that have been built into the fab­ric of the group. Lencioni’s ﬁc­tional startup is built on cap­i­tal­ist ax­ioms that in­her­ently un­der­mine the very points he’s try­ing to ar­gue. For in­stance, the root dys­func­tion he iden­ti­ﬁes is<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Lack of Trust”. There is lit­er­ally no rea­son, cause, or ben­e­ﬁt to<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>trusting” a cor­po­rate team. When em­ploy­ment is at will and there are no pro­tec­tions for work­ers, fo­cus­ing on in­di­vid­ual im­pact and the ap­pear­ance of pro­duc­tiv­ity to peers and higher ups be­comes the sole func­tion of work. Placing the goals and pri­or­i­ties of an or­ga­ni­za­tion above your own is deeply fool­ish when that same or­ga­ni­za­tion has no doubts or qualms about your place in it. The or­ga­ni­za­tion of struc­tural power de­ﬁnes the ab­sence or pres­ence trust, and in­di­vid­ual be­hav­ior has no sway on that power struc­ture.</p>\n<p>The dys­func­tions in to­tal are as fol­lows: Absence of trust, fear of con­ﬂict, lack of com­mit­ment, avoid­ance of ac­count­abil­ity, and inat­ten­tion to re­sults. When viewed through the lense of struc­tural power, it’s clear that ab­sence of trust and fear of con­ﬂict are two sides of the same coin - as are lack of com­mit­ment and avoid­ance of ac­count­abil­ity. All four are more eas­ily un­der­stood by the sys­tems that are in place for do­ing work rather than be­hav­iors of in­di­vid­u­als. The ﬁfth is per­haps true, but nearly tau­to­log­i­cal to the point of use­less­ness. To im­ply that a dys­func­tion team is inat­ten­tive to any re­sults is ab­surd, so the im­pli­ca­tion is that the team is inat­ten­tive to the <em>cor­rect</em> re­sults. If you fo­cus on the right thing you won’t be wrong. Not very help­ful. Again, the lense of or­ga­ni­za­tional power is help­ful: in­stead of ask­ing what re­sults are at­tended to, the ques­tion be­comes what re­sults are val­ued and re­warded.</p>\n<p>The ap­proach that Lencioni takes in demon­strat­ing (crudely) his ideal team also suf­fers from one of the key rhetor­i­cal traps out­lined in <em>Keywords: The New Language of Capitalism</em> by Leary - speak­ing of the cor­po­rate as if it where lit­er­ally cor­po­ral. The Team in this case be­comes em­bod­ied, and in do­ing so it erases the hu­man­ity of its mem­bers. This is the key con­tra­dic­tion in the dys­func­tions - Lencioni iden­ti­ﬁes that the only way to sub­li­mate ones in­di­vid­u­al­ity away for the sake of the cor­po­rate struc­ture is through in­di­vid­ual im­prove­ment, which he equates to moral im­prove­ment. This is per­haps less a ﬂaw in his rea­son­ing than a de­scrip­tion of cor­po­rate America’s ideal em­ployee. The cor­po­ra­tion de­sires all of the re­ward and ben­e­ﬁt of your la­bor, and the com­plete de­vo­tion of your­self to pro­duc­ing that la­bor, while dis­avow­ing any risks or con­se­quences that may at­tend it as your own per­sonal prob­lem. Lencioni de­serves credit at least for out­lin­ing the goals and struc­tures of vam­pire cap­i­tal­ism so clearly.</p>\n<p>Lencioni con­tin­ues to show that a team of lead­ers <em>must</em> nec­es­sar­ily re­move them­selves from the teams they lead, and cre­ate a clois­ter amongst them­selves. In do­ing so, he ad­vo­cates for plac­ing the goals of the col­lec­tive lead­er­ship team over their in­di­vid­ual goals and the goals of their in­di­vid­ual groups. This is the reg­u­lar party line for cor­po­rate tech­nocrats: the hu­mans be­low us whom we rely on to per­form la­bor mat­ters less than the group of peers who di­rect and proﬁt from that la­bor. This rhetoric per­forms two jobs; the ﬁrst is work­ing to dis­tance the pow­er­less from the pow­er­ful, and the sec­ond to jus­tify the dis­tance that the pow­er­ful al­ready sense be­tween them and their sub­jects. There can be no re­la­tion­ship of peers be­tween a rich owner of a com­pany and white col­lar work­ers whose la­bor they proﬁt from. It’s been known and ob­served that be­ing rich and own­ing com­pa­nies means you are no longer able to act like or un­der­stand peo­ple who are not rich or own com­pa­nies. You lose em­pa­thy for them, and see only other rich own­ers as your group of peers. Lencioni works to sooth any moral qualms the rich may have about this while in­doc­tri­nat­ing the mid­dle man­agers who are the true au­di­ence to the ne­ces­sity of align­ing with cap­i­tal over la­bor. This scene im­me­di­ately segues into our brave ex­ec­u­tive team hav­ing a con­ver­sa­tion about<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>adjusting the amount of re­sources al­lo­cated to en­gi­neer­ing” - in other word ﬁr­ing peo­ple.</p>\n<p>This is the core is­sue I have with the en­tire book. Any con­se­quences of wield­ing power are ﬁrmly de­nied - placed within the realm of the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>strategic de­ci­sion” while the po­lit­i­cal struc­ture of the cor­po­ra­tion de­mands and re­quires in­di­vid­ual sub­servience to col­lec­tive goals with ab­solutely no rec­i­p­ro­ca­tion of any kind. Sorry, it’s a strate­gic de­ci­sion and we’re al­lo­cat­ing re­sources else­where. Now your en­tire fam­ily does­n’t have health in­sur­ance. Is any­one truly sur­prised that an ab­sence of trust is en­demic to the cor­po­rate struc­ture?</p>\n<p>Lencioni goes on to demon­strate a ﬁr­ing in ac­tion.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>My hus­band is a lawyer so you will have a tough time mak­ing the case to ﬁre me?” What is this? This is in­sane. In what world do these peo­ple live in where at-will em­ploy­ment is­n’t a thing? You can be ﬁred at any time for any rea­son. The <span class=\"small-caps\">VP</span> in ques­tion goes on to ne­go­ti­ate her own ﬁr­ing. 3 months sev­er­ance and in­stant vest­ing of stock. Is this se­ri­ously how Lencioni imag­ines this works? Is this re­ally how this works for these peo­ple? Because for peo­ple like me it’s much more like<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>hand in your gun and your badge im­me­di­ately, we’ll give you two weeks sev­er­ance if you sign this <span class=\"small-caps\">NDA</span><span class=\"push-double\"></span><span class=\"pull-double\">”</span>. People like me <em>want</em> to be ﬁred so we can col­lect un­em­ploy­ment. And later,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Companies don’t usu­ally ﬁre con­trac­tors” what planet is this dude on?</p>\n<p>Through the book, Lencioni uses phrases and id­iomatic struc­tures that I don’t think I’ve ever en­coun­tered be­fore.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>Enter the dan­ger.” What does that mean? Is it the dan­ger zone?  These come at a quick pace, and are pre­sent in both the di­a­log and the in­ter­sti­tial nar­ra­tion. The over­all ef­fect is one of com­plete dis­ori­en­ta­tion, the feel­ing is that your bob­bing at sea in the text with­out be­ing able to get ﬁrm bear­ings on any sort of shared, con­sen­sus re­al­ity.<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>They called each other on the car­pet”?

This shows that Lencioni has ab­solutely no un­der­stand­ing of the power that the heads of ﬁrms do wield, as un­der­stand­ing the mech­a­nisms of that power would nec­es­sar­ily be pol­i­tics.</p>\n<p>In a scene where the ex­ec­u­tives are con­sid­er­ing sell­ing the com­pany, we see them weigh­ing the de­ci­sion in terms of their own per­sonal ben­e­ﬁt. This means they each own a good amount of stock. This means that they are own­ers of the com­pany. This means that they have a com­pletely dif­fer­ent re­la­tion­ship to the work as their em­ploy­ees, who are not own­ers, own no stock, and make no de­ci­sions. What does this do for our mid­dle man­ager au­di­ence? They re­ject the of­fer, so it must be a les­son in valu­ing the work over the money (or a re­in­force­ment that the whole point is to chase more and more money)</p>\n<p>The ﬁ­nal 35 pages of the book are the ac­tual sem­i­nar - Lencioni has padded 35 pages of con­tent into 222 (not count­ing the ﬁ­nal ded­i­ca­tion to the fallen of 9/11 to re­ally ce­ment the early 2000’s tone). The sem­i­nar in­cludes a ques­tion­naire that each mem­ber of a team should ﬁll out, how­ever it help­fully re­minds the reader that no part of the as­sess­ment may be re­pro­duced or stored in any way. I guess you have to buy every­one a book and have them ﬁll it out in the book. At the end of the as­sess­ment there is an ad­ver­tise­ment for Lencioni’s con­sult­ing ser­vices. The trans­par­ent grift is breath­tak­ing. The overview of the dys­func­tions so­lid­ify the slog of the pre­vi­ous ter­ri­ble ﬁc­tion: in short that the in­di­vid­ual be­hav­ior and in­ter­per­sonal re­la­tion­ships are more im­por­tant than or­ga­ni­za­tional struc­ture in deﬁn­ing out­comes, and that what be­hav­iors you are cur­rently do­ing are cor­rect but you should prob­a­bly hire Lencioni as a con­sul­tant be­cause it takes con­stant work and main­te­nance to avoid falling apart.</p>\n<p>In short, a per­fect grift to tell the Silicon Valley mid­dle man­ager or ex­ec­u­tive ex­actly what they want to hear, for­mu­lated in a way to ex­tract as much money out of them as pos­si­ble.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"A Clean Start for the Web","slug":"macwright/a-clean-start-for-the-web","thesis":"How do we make the web fun, participatory, and good?","source":"https://macwright.com/2020/08/22/clean-starts-for-the-web.html","author":"Tom Macwright","year":2020,"tags":"internet, web","collection":"bibliography","timestamp":null},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>The we­b’s evo­lu­tion over the last decade has mir­rored the American econ­omy.

And, sure, enough, some folks closer to the busi­ness side started click­ing all those but­tons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is an in­ter­est­ing way of throw­ing the busi­ness team un­der the bus for mak­ing choices that are ob­vi­ous to them and re­mov­ing our own cul­pa­bil­ity in build­ing these sys­tems.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How do we make the web fun, par­tic­i­pa­tory, and good?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is Tmcw’s the­sis: which ob­vi­ously has a ton of value judg­ment wrapped up in it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the cur­rent web which has ba­si­cally thrown away se­man­tic <span class=\"small-caps\">HTML</span> as an idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is that true or is that just a dig at the cur­rent dom­i­nant process and sys­tem?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then there’s the<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>application web”.

Where doc­u­ment web­sites adopt ap­pli­ca­tion pat­terns they of­ten ac­ci­den­tally sac­ri­ﬁce ac­ces­si­bil­ity, per­for­mance, and ma­chine read­abil­ity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I feel this is clas­sic Tmcw<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>get off my lawn” crank­i­ness. Rich Harris ad­dresses this: <code>It's a spectrum, and the interesting stuff happens in the middle. There's magic in that grey area.

The prob­lem is that we’ve cre­ated a dis­con­nect be­tween what we want to build, why we won’t to build it, and how we build it. We use in­sane tool­chains to solve sim­ple prob­lems, and not all tools are for the same thing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ap­peal of so­cial net­works is partly be­cause they let us cre­ate doc­u­ments with­out think­ing about web tech­nol­ogy, and they pro­vide guar­an­tees around per­for­mance, ac­ces­si­bil­ity, and pol­ish that oth­er­wise would take up our time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems like a de­cent point well made. Those of us who want to re­duce tech be­he­moth mono­cul­ture ab­solutely need to reckon with the real value that so­cial net­works of­fer to users.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stan­dards like <span class=\"small-caps\">RSS</span> and ser­vices like Instapaper show that pleas­ing for­mat­ting and dis­tri­b­u­tion can be done at the plat­form level and be pro­vided on top of ex­ist­ing vanilla web­sites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thats a de­cent proof of con­cept the prob­lem, as il­lus­trated above, is around the tools and sys­tems we’ve built for our­selves to make things<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>easier”.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Okay, so let’s say we’re cre­at­ing a new doc­u­ment web … First, you need a min­i­mal, stan­dard­ized markup lan­guage for send­ing doc­u­ments around. … Then, you need a browser … Could you build a pure-Mark­down-brows­ing browser that goes straight through this pipeline? Maybe?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a pretty in­ter­est­ing idea, but sounds like it’s ab­solutely a sub­set of the cur­rent sys­tem which is railed against above. Maybe the idea is that it can grow in­de­pen­dently  <em>from</em> be­ing a sub­set <em>to</em> be­ing some­thing more.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The prob­lem with imag­in­ing the ap­pli­ca­tion web is that it’s pretty ex­pan­sive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah no shit tmcw.

Our medium tho is that of the tech­ni­cal mono­cul­ture, the baked in as­sump­tions that a small group has used to cre­ate this new world.

This is a so­cial­ist ar­gu­ment for the web, and I wholly agree with it. I think that he needs to be ex­plicit about what he’s ac­tu­ally call­ing for and imag­ine what the real world reper­cus­sions of the po­si­tion would be, and how we need to make the same call of our so­ci­ety for the same ends.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"The Design System Between Us","slug":"marcotte/the-design-system-between-us","author":"Ethan Marcotte","year":2020,"source":"https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-design-systems-between-us","thesis":"Design systems by default entrench existing workflows rather than changing them.","tags":"design systems, design/development","collection":"bibliography","timestamp":null},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>But in my ex­pe­ri­ence, de­sign sys­tems haven’t brought this kind of rich, cross-func­tional col­lab­o­ra­tion to most or­ga­ni­za­tions.

This re­mains un­changed since 2016, hence the ar­ti­cles the­sis.

Critical path im­ages for <span class=\"small-caps\">LCP</span>, if any, need to sub­tract their trans­fer size from one of these buck­ets, with trades against <span class=\"small-caps\">JS</span> bun­dle size po­ten­tially in­creas­ing to­tal down­load bud­get, but the de­tails mat­ter a great deal. For<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>modern” pages, half a megabyte is a de­cent hard bud­get.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Russel ends op­ti­misti­cally, not­ing that the broader in­dus­try has got­ten more se­ri­ous about real user met­rics and at­tempt­ing to un­der­stand the real-world ecosys­tem across the globe, but calls out specif­i­cally the front-end in­dus­try pro­fes­sion­als and sug­gests that we all need to put the health of the sys­tem be­fore our own de­sire for com­fort.</p>\n<p>This site — as of writ­ing this an­no­ta­tion on 2021.03.12 — sends 166kB over the wire and de­com­presses to 301kB.

On an em­u­lated Moto <span class=\"small-caps\">G4</span>, Lighthouse gives us a time-to-in­ter­ac­tive of 1.2s.

This makes me think that there has to be a split be­tween<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>acting eth­i­cally” and<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>being eth­i­cal”.

We live in a time of un­prece­dented ef­ﬁ­ciency, un­be­liev­able abun­dance, and mas­sive wealth but if a <em>restau­rant</em> is called to truly ac­count for its ex­ploita­tion to charge its true price, it’s im­me­di­ately un­ten­able. This feels like it must be true across many in­dus­tries&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Uber would rather cease ser­vice in California than treat it’s dri­vers like em­ploy­ees. What would it take to truly un­der­stand what the net­work of costs, val­ues, debts, and the real price of things?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The prob­lem of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>good” food be­ing pro­hib­i­tively ex­pen­sive can’t be com­pletely solved by restau­ra­teurs turn­ing those knobs. Depressed wages and in­ﬂa­tion are prob­lems for every­one, not just restau­rant work­ers</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are those re­ally two is­sues at work? I get the sense that those are both symp­toms of an un­der­ly­ing dis­con­nec­tion be­tween la­bor &amp; re­sources and con­sump­tion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now,<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>value” can in­clude not just cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence, but the knowl­edge that em­ployee well-be­ing is part of the plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is that a value add?? Are we now just sell­ing eth­i­cal choices, and let­ting the con­cept of the mar­ket de­ter­mine how we can work? Because than we’re just play­ing the same game with the rich be­ing able to<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>choose” eth­i­cal con­sump­tion meth­ods and pur­chase the abil­ity to do the right thing, which ab­solves them of re­spon­si­bil­ity to change the sys­tem and sup­port sys­temic re­form. I guess this is the clas­sic re­form vs rev­o­lu­tion prob­lem, and the source of rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies at­tack­ing re­form­ers for mak­ing a bro­ken sys­tem more bear­able in­stead of truly ﬁx­ing it. Again tho&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the sys­tem is­n’t bro­ken but de­signed. Getting out of that polemic means iden­ti­fy­ing the de­sign.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But every­thing restau­rants can do on their own is a few drops in a bucket com­pared to what gov­ern­ment sup­port in the form of things like uni­ver­sal health care, or real aid for small busi­nesses, could achieve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thats the dream that ar­tic­u­lated by Star Trek&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;gov­ern­ment en­ti­ties who have the abil­ity to make real change <em>do</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sustained change will take a greater un­der­stand­ing of what<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>equity” means, and what it will re­quire from both restau­rants and cus­tomers. As bad as the pan­demic has been, it has put us in a great po­si­tion to do that sort of reeval­u­a­tion, and reimag­ine a restau­rant as a place where suc­cess does­n’t mean proﬁt, but rather that the whole com­mu­nity, farm-to-table, is cared for. And to maybe even ﬁght for a day when it won’t be the re­spon­si­bil­ity of restau­rants to solve these prob­lems at all</p>\n</blockquote>\n"}]
