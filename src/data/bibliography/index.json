This applies for GUIs or CLIs, end user or developer experiences. Those are the two big human/machine questions.</p>\n<p>Tools for differentiating include shape coding:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The right panel (“Aircraft Multiple Flight Controls”) clearly distinguishes between the throttle (large, linear vertical movement), toggle switches (round vertical flick) and the push buttons (square push-in).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Colour coding is perhaps the only one to break into our everyday vocabulary, but we can add four more: size, texture, position and operation coding. Together these six are our allies in the design of error-proof interfaces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Differentiation is a good first step that will avoid confusion between adjacent switches. But its only with organisation that we can create a clear and accurate mental model of the interface for the user.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Differentiation support organization.</p>\n<p>Organizational techniques include distributed and consolidated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These panels are what I’d called a consolidated interface. Every piece of input and feedback has been moved onto the same panel. This is the approach that Dyson took with their car. Now imagine the opposite, moving each of those lights and switches to the actual location of that valve in the factory. Sounds ludicrous, but these air vents in the Audi TT show that this distributed approach can also be a great win for user experience. I wrote a lot more about these distributed interfaces last year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Feature based, operation based, technology based.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any touchscreen with buttons by the side exhibits this technology-based split. In a future world, SpaceX might embed these physical controls right inside the screen next to the information they affect, but for now they sit awkwardly by the side as if nothing is wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Technology based organization is not human centered, and therefor not ideal UX.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"Everything Easy is Hard Again","slug":"chimero/everything-easy-is-hard-again","author":"Frank Chimero","source":"https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/","tags":"internet, web","collection":"bibliography","timestamp":null},"content":""},{"meta":{"title":"The Most Exciting Design Systems Are Boring","author":"Josh Clarg","slug":"clark/the-most-exciting-design-systems-are-boring","year":2017,"source":"https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html","thesis":"What it says on the tin.","tags":"design systems, design/development","collection":"bibliography","timestamp":null},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>Design-system builders should resist the lure of the new.

Right on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”The purists reference strongly to the architectural characteristics of Web Brutalism, such as the concept of ‘truth to materials’ and the use of the purest markup elements available. The UX minimalists, in contrast, see efficiency and performance as the main driver of Web Brutalism and even believe that the radical limitation of possibilities can boost conversions. The ‘anti-ists’ or artists see web design as an (still) undervalued form of art and don’t show much respect [to] the status quo and mostly get bad press.“</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Pascal Deville, https://brutalistwebsites.com/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reference: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/split-personality-brutalist-web-development/</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of what’s labeled Web Brutalism is a normcore visual aesthetic — the web version of anti-art, a rejection of refinement and sophistication — rather than a meaningful digital analogue to architectural Brutalism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I ... don't think that's true? Web Brutalist are highly refined and sophisticated aesthetic approaches, its just that they revel in a the ironic (so I guess I agree with the &quot;norm core&quot; part).</p>\n<p>After a quick overview of the term <em>Brutalism</em> in it's original architecture context, Dorn identifies the tension at the heart of the style that will pivot to our discussion of the web:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The debate asks the question, To what extent should an object reveal its structure and operation to the user?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reminds me of: https://designportland.org/stories/2016/what-do-we-lose-when-its-easy-to-use</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Proponents of seamfulness argue that revealing an object’s complexity and operation can aid usability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See Chalmers and Galani: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1013115.1013149</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seamlessness emphasizes concealment; seamfulness emphasizes transparency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dorn identifies Web Brutalism as a rejection of the high-corporate, contextless slickness of Apple and Google, which I very much agree with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The anti-art aesthetic has become the face of Web Brutalism because it's fun and edgy and all the cool kids are doing it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This gives me concern tho, as I see &quot;anti-art&quot; as fundamentally anathema to the Web Brutalist ethos. Dorn follows with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>… [the] purists, minimalists, and anti-ists are all asking, in their own way, what it means to make something on the web that is true to the web</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is the sort of question and practice that <em>artists</em> engage with.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the true material of the web? … But taking it somewhere in-between, seeing the web as primarily an information medium, we can ask the question a little differently: what does it look like to design something that is true to the material of digital information?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The structure of [Notion] reflects the structure of the web itself: digital content is purposefully formatted, like semantic HTML elements, and exists in a hierarchical structure (directories on the web, nested pages in Notion), yet can be linked and referenced to create a complex network of information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a great way to identify how to design in a way that is honest to the material of the web, and is I think so foundational and fundamental to good web design that it feels obvious when stated like this but is so often overlooked and one poorly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the essence and opportunity of Web Brutalism: more than a utilitarian aesthetic, it’s a way of creating spaces for thought and expression on the web that reflect the nature of thought and the web.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yessssssss. This is a great way of looking at what it means to operate with Web Brutalism as a design principle rather than an aesthetic movement.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"Medium Design","slug":"easterling/medium-design","author":"Keller Easterling","year":2020,"source":"https://www.e-flux.com/journal/106/312238/medium-design/","tags":"design","thesis":"To design effectively with a medium, knowledge and solutions to a system are less effective than understanding the relationships within the system, and how to manipulate and adjust those systems to move towards a set of outcomes.","collection":"bibliography","timestamp":null},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>… culture, in the broadest sense of the word, is good at pointing to things and naming them, but not so good at describing relationships between things.

Out the gate we're coming out strong with a hard-eyed look at one of the major flaws of contemporary culture – this includes politics and economics as well as tech and design. This should be incisive.</p>\n<p>Easterling sketches a mode of thinking where &quot;Favoring succession rather than coexistence, the new right answer must kill the old right answer.&quot; Our broader culture – and out individual outlook – is unable to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time as &quot;correct&quot;. Like the Highlander, there can only be one. We want to know the one right answer.</p>\n<p>This mode of thinking and gathering knowledge – this one single idea of what &quot;progress&quot; entails – creates situations where we ratchet ourselves tighter and tighter into untenable situations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since the world’s big bullies and bulletproof forms of power—superbugs like Trump, Kim, Putin, and Bibi, or free-zone agglomerations of corporate power—thrive on this oscillation between loop and binary, it is as if there is nothing to counter them—only more ways of fighting and being right and providing the rancor that nourishes their violence. Is it possible to drop through a trapdoor and exit these logics?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>… A radical proposal has no traction, because nothing is new and nothing is right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Holy shiiiit. Easterling is rejecting the core premise of so many TED talks and thought leaders. There is no new way. There is no right answer. The only way forward lies in ambiguity. This immediately calls to mind Nim Wunnans <a href=\"http://conceptuallabor.com/\">Theory of Conceptual Labor</a>, where he identifies that the core location of &quot;doing good work&quot; is necessary defined by and situated within ambiguity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no end or modernist succession or moment after culture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This makes me recall some of the essays in the White Chapel collection of writing &quot;Time&quot; about the meaning and function of contemporary art – how we exist now in a space of the post-contemporary, and work created now can interact with and change the meaning of work created in the past. Cut loose from any sense of linear succession, all artworks can inflect each other and grow from each other freely.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clear of associations with communication technologies, medium, in this context, returns to its root, medius, meaning “middle” or “milieu.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Easterling starts to transition here to the meat of the essay.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Beyond declared ideologies, here is a matrix or medium of activities and latent potentials—the undeclared dispositions that are something like culture’s muscle memory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This reminds me of what Hal Foster was attempting to do in <em>Design and Crime</em>, create a &quot;running room&quot; for culture thats less bounded by what Easterling calls &quot;loops and binaries&quot;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>you see things with names and hear humans speaking words but those things cannot be comprehended in the absence of a thousand other affective cues and relative positions between things in context</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Context, a broad gestalt understanding, becomes the key to successfully navigating and manipulating the medium. The complex tangle of objects relationships and affordances create a map of the possible, one that's as broad as a colorspace and – lacking any defined set of instructions – just as open and possible.</p>\n<p>This way of thinking is shocking to me – it so clearly describes my own way of working that the recognition is deeply surprising. Familiar and new – it's interesting to see my own way of thinking described in such a clear way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Turning the sound down on those declarations, it is also easier to detect the difference between what an organization is saying and what it is doing, and how organizations decouple their messages and ideologies from their real activities, underlying motivations, and structuring logics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning is created and divined by comprehending or being receptive to the whole. Everything – and everything connections between – becomes semantic. Language and marked declarations of meaning are quite possible unreliable narrators of this type of experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The disposition of any organization makes some things possible and some things impossible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God damn Easterling! Just go out there and say it. This is <em>deeply</em> related to my critique of <a href=\"/bibliography/lencioni/five-disfunctions\"><em>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</em></a>. The structure and gestalt of an organization is the primary defining factor of dysfunction and success, rather than any individual actor.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For instance, being right is a really bad idea on the other side. It is too weak. It does not work against gurus and totalitarian bullies. Maybe culture’s spectacular failures, together with the underexploited powers of the medium, could inspire alternative ways to register the imagination—other approaches to form-making and design in any discipline.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Focus on right-ness is a core value of our system, and look at the results of that system. Sheesh.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Entanglements are more productive than solutions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is just … such an articulation against everything that silicon valley tech-fetishism espouses. This is so compelling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Design in the medium is less like making a thing and more like having your hands on the faders and toggles of organization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is deeply related to the thesis I outlined in <a href=\"/texts/how-to-design-while-developing\">How to Design While Developing</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is the design of interdependencies, chemistries, chain reactions. It benefits from an artistic curiosity about spatial wiring or reagents in spatial mixtures. You are designing not only a single object but a platform for inflecting populations of objects or setting up relative potentials within them. You are comfortable with dynamic markers and unfinished processes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is perhaps the single best definition of web design I have very seen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And maybe the existence or content of a problem is less important than the interplay between problems. Failure is a limitless wilderness for design ecologies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Welcome to … the Internet. This is exactly how we generate successful work in the medium of the internet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If an unsafe factory collapses or burns, there is an event to mark the violence, but in countless factories or industrial parks that do not buckle under the weight of their own denial, there is no event, no drawn sword. There is only latent temperament—the constant aggression of blatantly imbalanced power dynamics. The potential for either concentrating or distributing power; the potential for escalating or reducing violence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Easterling here defines the struggle with the modern web. Is there a connection here to what it would mean to practice an ethical web design? Not to have answers or solutions, but to navigate the tangled web of semantics in ways that reduce the potential for violence, that ratchet slowly towards an ethical stance</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if it has any hope of effecting change, it manipulates the organization as well as the instrumental narrative that attends it with moves that are potentially sneakier or more politically agile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A key takeaway here is that in order to produce effective work <em>in the world</em> part of the work needs to be done <em>to the organization</em>. Changing the organization and structure around the work is the only way to produce work that is different or more effective.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"Foucault's Pendulum","slug":"eco/foucaults-pendulum","author":"Umberto Eco","year":1982,"source":"https://bookshop.org/books/foucault-s-pendulum-9780151327652/9780156032971","tags":"conspiracies, numerology","thesis":"The horror of meaninglessness leads us to seek a deeper meaning in pareidolic connections of arbitrary facts.

The fundamental premise of the novel is that there are a lot of coincidences around historical stories that have really unsatisfying explanations, and in to this void step the gnostics, who are sure that there is something that can be known that will explain everything. And by everything, we get to explanations of <em>everything</em>. Our protagonists Casaubon, Belbo, and Diatollevi, seek to create the grand unified theory of everything. They build on gnostic traditions and methods to explain a cohesive story of the unexplained. They call is &quot;The Plan&quot;. Initially they do it from a sense of cynical parody, then from an attempt to extract money from their marks, and ultimately they fall victim to the appeal of the pareidolic connection, and convince themselves that this is a natural way of interpreting history.

What's more, the whole things is written with an air of approachability and dry cutting wit. The book is makes me want to loan it to everyone I know and stop writing, since I'll never be able to write as well, as insightfully, or as entertainingly as Hossenfelder. Anyway, on to the content!</p>\n<p>Hossenfelder covers a <em>lot</em> of ground in this slim novel, and all of it is interesting. For this annotation however, I'm going to focus on her argumentation around aesthetic influence over hard science, my take on the root causes of the problems she identifies, and Appendix C — &quot;What You Can Do To Help&quot; — which I found surprisingly relevant to issues in &quot;The Industry&quot; of web development.</p>\n<p>Let's start with Aesthetics. Coming as I do from a fine arts background, and working now in a &quot;technical&quot; field, there's an interesting tension at work with aesthetics. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the arts have long <em>rejected</em> aesthetic criteria for determining value — and contemporary artists like <a href=\"http://morganrosskopf.com/\">Morgan Rosskopf</a> are working to reclaim it's importance in the field — while Hossenfelder posits that aesthetics are <em>too dominant</em> as criteria in theoretical physics. Why this is the case is an interesting question, but it's worth noting that they mean the same thing when they use the word: beauty for the sake of being beautiful. (As a counter to this, I had a funny moment when Hossenfelder referred to phenomenologists of physics, and when I flipped <em>immediately</em> to the footnote on this term she had written &quot;not that kind of phenomenologist.) Hossenfelder's primary argument is that aesthetic concerns are primarily <em>anthropocentric</em> concerns, and when exploring the most fundamental questions of &quot;what the fuck, why?&quot;, reality has little regard for the anthropocentric. She cites numerous examples where the best answers to the question of &quot;why&quot; are deeply anti-human — that is, they are repugnant to even the scientists who propose them. We don't like the way the universe works, and the universe doesn't give a <em>shit</em>. It is what it is. While the physics is fun and the interviews are great, where this story gets <em>really</em> interesting is in a sort of applied Bruno Latour &quot;facts are socially constructed&quot; sort of way, which brings me to my next interest in the book.</p>\n<p>Hossenfelder makes a compelling case that while <em>the fundamental principles of the universe</em> don't give a shit about anthropocentric aesthetics, editorial boards of publications and  people who control grant money sure do. It's like Keats' old &quot;  &quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty, — that is all Ye know on earth, ye and all ye need to know.&quot; But swap &quot;truth&quot; for &quot;funding&quot;. Here, Hossenfelder uses her argument <em>against</em> aesthetics as criteria for determining value as a proxy for economic and political systemic pressures corrupting the scientific process. If continued funding relies on a predetermined result (and that result is predetermined based on aesthetic criteria) a researcher finding that result should be viewed with suspicion rather than celebration. This is not the case currently. My take-away is less that the problem Hossenfelder identifies within the community of theoretical physics is an over-reliance on aesthetic criteria (the primary hook of the book) and more that the social structure of contemporary life under late-stage capitalism is inherently antithetical to meaningful, substantive research. Hossenfelder cites growing economic inequity and insecurity as prime forces in the creation of the current climate of human-centered motivations for research directions. It's easy to come to conclusions that your boss likes when your paycheck is on the line.</p>\n<p>Particularly striking was Hossenfelders Appendix C, &quot;What You Can Do To Help&quot;. &quot;Help&quot; in this case refers to &quot;help mitigate the dominance of anthropocentric biases in research of fundamentally human-agnostic areas&quot;. Hossenfelder organizes this section into three parts, one for the performer of researcher, one for the funder or validator of research, and one of the consumer or observer of research. For the performer of research, Hossenfelders advice is fundamentally about understanding and counteracting <em>social systems</em> and <em>cognitive biases</em>. She elevates the concept of criticism and centers an individual's power against organizational issues in the power to say &quot;No&quot;. For the funder or validator of research, Hossenfelders advice is about creating barriers between the researcher and the ravages of capitalism. She praises tenure, proposes defenses against the constant hustle, supports graceful  abandonment of previous work, and — most importantly — makes clear that &quot;learning new things&quot; and &quot;making money&quot; may not have any meaningful overlap <em>at all</em>. Hossenfelders advice to the rest of us is that we need to be aware and cognizant of social and economic pressures on scientists — especially particular popular pop-sci writers and personalities — and what that implies about the theory they're peddling. We all know that Koch-founded climate scientists are not to be trusted, but is the 2-year-contract post-doc struggling to make rent any more reliable? Our current system incentivizes pleasing rich individuals and organizations in order to escape the nightmare of economic precarity. Academics with massive outstanding student debt are not less immune to this than the rest of us.</p>\n<p>In this Appendix C I saw the most overlap with my own industry — web development and the creation of the internet. It's too easy for us to pretend that we serve this higher purpose, this call to meet the needs of humans and <em>solve hard problems</em>. The reality is that we are just as susceptible to the social and cognitive biases as anyone else, and our motivations are consistently undermined and conflicted by our need to stay employable and fundable.

This suggests that modern frameworks explicitly are avoiding a mobile-first mentality, and relying on contemporary hardware.</p>\n<p>To wrap up, Kadlec suggests that this data isn't indicative of the baseline performance capabilities of a framework, but rather indicates that the <em>implementation</em> is at fault. If in general the implementation of a framework is causing performance issues, that the primary fault is in the ecosystem, documentation, and community standards around that framework.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team","slug":"lencioni/five-disfunctions","author":"Patrick Lencioni","year":2002,"source":"https://www.tablegroup.com/books/dysfunctions/","tags":"business, teamwork","thesis":"Someone sent me a copy of _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_. I didn't really like it.","collection":"bibliography","timestamp":null},"content":"<p><em>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team</em> by Lencioni reads like middle-manager fan fiction. Beyond the outrageously bad dialogue and cutely arranged set pieces, all spread out across large type, short chapters, and generous white space to pad this brief seminar into a “real book”, Lencioni’s thesis throughout is freighted with the zeitgeist of the early 2000s late capitalist striving.</p>\n<p>Structuring this self-help seminar for middle managers disillusioned with their directionless grind to nowhere as a &quot;fable&quot; (or &quot;bad fiction&quot;) makes it read like a shockingly earnest first draft of Max Barry's <em>Company</em>, which is a satirical skewering of corporate management consultants and practices.</p>\n<p>Team dysfunctions are seen as failings of individual actions, and that the behavior of individuals in a team is the root cause for failure of the team. This implies that behaving differently in an organization is enough to the change the outcomes of that organization. This is flatly untrue - individuals have little to no ability to change the outcomes of structural and organizational decisions that have been built into the fabric of the group. Lencioni’s fictional startup is built on capitalist axioms that inherently undermine the very points he’s trying to argue. For instance, the root dysfunction he identifies is &quot;Lack of Trust&quot;. There is literally no reason, cause, or benefit to “trusting” a corporate team. When employment is at will and there are no protections for workers, focusing on individual impact and the appearance of productivity to peers and higher ups becomes the sole function of work. Placing the goals and priorities of an organization above your own is deeply foolish when that same organization has no doubts or qualms about your place in it. The organization of structural power defines the absence or presence trust, and individual behavior has no sway on that power structure.</p>\n<p>The dysfunctions in total are as follows: Absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results. When viewed through the lense of structural power, it’s clear that absence of trust and fear of conflict are two sides of the same coin - as are lack of commitment and avoidance of accountability. All four are more easily understood by the systems that are in place for doing work rather than behaviors of individuals. The fifth is perhaps true, but nearly tautological to the point of uselessness. To imply that a dysfunction team is inattentive to any results is absurd, so the implication is that the team is inattentive to the <em>correct</em> results. If you focus on the right thing you won’t be wrong. Not very helpful. Again, the lense of organizational power is helpful: instead of asking what results are attended to, the question becomes what results are valued and rewarded.</p>\n<p>The approach that Lencioni takes in demonstrating (crudely) his ideal team also suffers from one of the key rhetorical traps outlined in <em>Keywords: The New Language of Capitalism</em> by Leary - speaking of the corporate as if it where literally corporal. The Team in this case becomes embodied, and in doing so it erases the humanity of its members. This is the key contradiction in the dysfunctions - Lencioni identifies that the only way to sublimate ones individuality away for the sake of the corporate structure is through individual improvement, which he equates to moral improvement. This is perhaps less a flaw in his reasoning than a description of corporate America’s ideal employee. The corporation desires all of the reward and benefit of your labor, and the complete devotion of yourself to producing that labor, while disavowing any risks or consequences that may attend it as your own personal problem. Lencioni deserves credit at least for outlining the goals and structures of vampire capitalism so clearly.</p>\n<p>Lencioni continues to show that a team of leaders <em>must</em> necessarily remove themselves from the teams they lead, and create a cloister amongst themselves. In doing so, he advocates for placing the goals of the collective leadership team over their individual goals and the goals of their individual groups. This is the regular party line for corporate technocrats: the humans below us whom we rely on to perform labor matters less than the group of peers who direct and profit from that labor. This rhetoric performs two jobs; the first is working to distance the powerless from the powerful, and the second to justify the distance that the powerful already sense between them and their subjects. There can be no relationship of peers between a rich owner of a company and white collar workers whose labor they profit from. It’s been known and observed that being rich and owning companies means you are no longer able to act like or understand people who are not rich or own companies. You lose empathy for them, and see only other rich owners as your group of peers. Lencioni works to sooth any moral qualms the rich may have about this while indoctrinating the middle managers who are the true audience to the necessity of aligning with capital over labor. This scene immediately segues into our brave executive team having a conversation about “adjusting the amount of resources allocated to engineering” - in other word firing people.</p>\n<p>This is the core issue I have with the entire book. Any consequences of wielding power are firmly denied - placed within the realm of the “strategic decision” while the political structure of the corporation demands and requires individual subservience to collective goals with absolutely no reciprocation of any kind. Sorry, it’s a strategic decision and we're allocating resources elsewhere. Now your entire family doesn’t have health insurance. Is anyone truly surprised that an absence of trust is endemic to the corporate structure?</p>\n<p>Lencioni goes on to demonstrate a firing in action. “My husband is a lawyer so you will have a tough time making the case to fire me?” What is this? This is insane. In what world do these people live in where at-will employment isn’t a thing? You can be fired at any time for any reason. The VP in question goes on to negotiate her own firing. 3 months severance and instant vesting of stock. Is this seriously how Lencioni imagines this works? Is this really how this works for these people? Because for people like me it’s much more like “hand in your gun and your badge immediately, we’ll give you two weeks severance if you sign this NDA”. People like me <em>want</em> to be fired so we can collect unemployment. And later, “Companies don’t usually fire contractors” what planet is this dude on?</p>\n<p>Through the book, Lencioni uses phrases and idiomatic structures that I don’t think I’ve ever encountered before. “Enter the danger.” What does that mean? Is it the danger zone?  These come at a quick pace, and are present in both the dialog and the interstitial narration. The overall effect is one of complete disorientation, the feeling is that your bobbing at sea in the text without being able to get firm bearings on any sort of shared, consensus reality. “They called each other on the carpet”? What the fuck?</p>\n<p>Our hero’s behavior definitely looks like what CEOs and top brass like to pretend they are doing, so we’re creating tautological support for managers to continue doing whatever they are already doing and dressing it up as an insight. The only thing that’s surprising about this grift is that I didn’t realize what was happening sooner.</p>\n<p>This book has a terrible definition of politics - instead of embracing that politics is the application of power (and therefor inherent and necessary in any social group, especially a firm) Lencioni seems to define politics as dishonest interpersonal behavior -“acting a given way in order to solicit a certain reaction” or something. This shows that Lencioni has absolutely no understanding of the power that the heads of firms do wield, as understanding the mechanisms of that power would necessarily be politics.</p>\n<p>In a scene where the executives are considering selling the company, we see them weighing the decision in terms of their own personal benefit. This means they each own a good amount of stock. This means that they are owners of the company. This means that they have a completely different relationship to the work as their employees, who are not owners, own no stock, and make no decisions. What does this do for our middle manager audience? They reject the offer, so it must be a lesson in valuing the work over the money (or a reinforcement that the whole point is to chase more and more money)</p>\n<p>The final 35 pages of the book are the actual seminar - Lencioni has padded 35 pages of content into 222 (not counting the final dedication to the fallen of 9/11 to really cement the early 2000’s tone). The seminar includes a questionnaire that each member of a team should fill out, however it helpfully reminds the reader that no part of the assessment may be reproduced or stored in any way. I guess you have to buy everyone a book and have them fill it out in the book. At the end of the assessment there is an advertisement for Lencioni’s consulting services. The transparent grift is breathtaking. The overview of the dysfunctions solidify the slog of the previous terrible fiction: in short that the individual behavior and interpersonal relationships are more important than organizational structure in defining outcomes, and that what behaviors you are currently doing are correct but you should probably hire Lencioni as a consultant because it takes constant work and maintenance to avoid falling apart.</p>\n<p>In short, a perfect grift to tell the Silicon Valley middle manager or executive exactly what they want to hear, formulated in a way to extract as much money out of them as possible.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"prefers-reduced-motion; Taking a no-motion-first approach to animations","slug":"mac/prefers-reduced-motion","source":"https://tatianamac.com/posts/prefers-reduced-motion/","author":"Tatiana Mac","year":2021,"tags":"internet, design, a11y, accessibility, css, development","thesis":"Use the prefers-reduced-motion media query to help guide your animation principles.

Importantly, Mac notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to make a critical note here that this is operating on a no-consent model. Ew. The user hasn't necessarily opted into animations. They just haven't checked &quot;Reduce motion.&quot; That could be because they like and can tolerate animations, or, it's equally possible the user doesn't know about this setting. So, I want us to make sure we're not assuming that these users necessarily want animations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mac cuts through what could easily be bad assumptions at the beginning of a project. Thinking carefully about what our starting assumptions — our front end axioms if you will — <em>actually are and are not</em> is of critical importance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Start with No Motion … When I collaborate with a designer/animator on an animation, I first ask, &quot;Is this animation critical to understanding the content?&quot; … More often than not, the answer is &quot;no.&quot; … When conceived well, animations should be an enhancement to an explanation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mac will then default to <code>animation: none</code>, removing all animation entirely. Therefor, following the <code>first</code> methodology, we only <em>add</em> animation if the user settings are explicit about <code>no-preference</code>. Mac notes that the <code>first</code> methodology means that for older browsers without support for the media query, we default to the <em>more accessible</em> option. This is related to <a href=\"/bibliography/pickering/is-progressive-enhancement-dead-yet\">Pickering's explanation of Progressive Enhancement.</a>.</p>\n<p>Mac than notes that we can remove <em>all</em> the animations from the base style sheet bundle, and only serve them <em>if the user has <code>no-preference</code> set</em></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;link\n  <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;animations.css&quot;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">media</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)&quot;</span>\n/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is rather clever, because it creates an argument from performance for following a principle for accessibility.</p>\n<p>Mac then fleshes out a scenario where the designer has determined that the animation is in fact <em>critical</em> to the interaction. My favorite question to ask in this case (and Mac's &quot;spiciest&quot; is their direct and to the point &quot;If the animation can't load for someone or they can't see it, what was your plan?&quot;.</p>\n<p>Mac than moves to exploring other, non-css based animations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Auto-playing video: Don't do it. Just, don't do it.</li>\n<li>JavaScript animations: find a way to respect the setting, those tools are there. My take: don't do it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mac ends the article with their own references.</p>\n<p>I particularly like and am compelled by Mac's argument that &quot;by default we should do the most accessible thing&quot; which is very close to my own principle of &quot;do as little as possible&quot; or &quot;keep it stupid simple&quot;, as well as Mac's commitment to knowing what the user settings are and respecting <em>all of them</em>.

Where document websites adopt application patterns they often accidentally sacrifice accessibility, performance, and machine readability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I feel this is classic Tmcw &quot;get off my lawn&quot; crankiness. Rich Harris addresses this: <code>It's a spectrum, and the interesting stuff happens in the middle. There's magic in that grey area. I still believe the web has the potential to be a fundamentally more expressive medium than its predecessors (http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/ is on a similar wavelength to that notion)</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The application web uses JSX, not HTML, and would like that in the browser itself, or Svelte, instead of JavaScript, and would like that too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Haha our boy is coming for Rich! I'm not I understand what the dig here is … he's mad at a language that has a compile step? Isn't that what like … most applications use? Rust, C, whatever, they all compile down to a native runtime language.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I read blog posts from ‘traditional web developers’ who are mad that HTML &amp; CSS aren’t enough anymore and that everything is complicated – I think this is largely that the application stack for building websites has replaced the document stack in a lot of places.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I mean, that's a decent point. The problem is that we've created a disconnect between what we want to build, why we won't to build it, and how we build it. We use insane toolchains to solve simple problems, and not all tools are for the same thing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The appeal of social networks is partly because they let us create documents without thinking about web technology, and they provide guarantees around performance, accessibility, and polish that otherwise would take up our time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems like a decent point well made. Those of us who want to reduce tech behemoth monoculture absolutely need to reckon with the real value that social networks offer to users.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>standards like RSS and services like Instapaper show that pleasing formatting and distribution can be done at the platform level and be provided on top of existing vanilla websites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thats a decent proof of concept the problem, as illustrated above, is around the tools and systems we've built for ourselves to make things &quot;easier&quot;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Okay, so let’s say we’re creating a new document web … First, you need a minimal, standardized markup language for sending documents around. … Then, you need a browser … Could you build a pure-Markdown-browsing browser that goes straight through this pipeline? Maybe?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a pretty interesting idea, but sounds like it's absolutely a subset of the current system which is railed against above. Maybe the idea is that it can grow independently  <em>from</em> being a subset <em>to</em> being something more.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem with imagining the application web is that it’s pretty expansive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah no shit tmcw. Im not sure how any of this gets around the problem outlined above: hostile takeover of a public spec by private tech behemoths.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The worse the ‘Mac App Store’ and ‘Windows App Store’ and ’App Store’ and ’Play Store’ get, the bigger a cut those monopolies demand, the more it costs to be a Mac or Windows developer, the more that applications get pushed to the web. Sure, some applications are better on the web. But a lot are just there because it’s the only place left where you can easily, cheaply, and freely share or sell a product.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Creating an &quot;App Web&quot; could so easily just colonize that space with those same models of monoculture.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are a lot of other ways to look at and solve this problem. I think it is a problem, for everyone except Google.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Right, this is the goal for Google. And creating a new set of specs is not going to <em>solve</em> that problem, because that problem is a reflection of our current society and what we value and how we work.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea of a web browser being something we can comprehend, of a web page being something that more people can make, feels exciting to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a good goal, and I endorse it! Our medium tho is that of the technical monoculture, the baked in assumptions that a small group has used to create this new world. The issue is with the hardware and the physical things and the human society that surrounds and makes those things possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What if we could start over?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tmcw is calling for a revolution of the web without being so explicit about it. The idea he is presenting is that there needs to be a messy, democratic, socialist approach to our <em>specs</em> that create more room for the individual, and that in empowering the individual with rights also creates a number of responsibilities to the society that they must uphold. This is a socialist argument for the web, and I wholly agree with it. I think that he needs to be explicit about what he's actually calling for and imagine what the real world repercussions of the position would be, and how we need to make the same call of our society for the same ends.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"The Design System Between Us","slug":"marcotte/the-design-system-between-us","author":"Ethan Marcotte","year":2020,"source":"https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-design-systems-between-us","thesis":"Design systems by default entrench existing workflows rather than changing them.","tags":"design systems, design/development","collection":"bibliography","timestamp":null},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>But in my experience, design systems haven’t brought this kind of rich, cross-functional collaboration to most organizations.

Pickering thinks that putting progressive enhancement to bed – and worrying about it no more would be a &quot;grave&quot; mistake.</p>\n<p>Pickering addresses some common misconceptions.</p>\n<p>Progressive Enhancement is Not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Something you install using a package manager.</li>\n<li>Progressive enhancement is not a <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag with the text &quot;Please turn on Javascript&quot;.</li>\n<li>Progressive enhancement is not rendering HTML on the server, then having the browser re-render that HTML via hydration (<em>React</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pickering uses an metaphor of the skateboard to explain what progressive enhancement <em>is</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine two skateboards. One is the old fashioned kind, it's just a board with wheels. The other has a screw hole near the front, allowing you to attach some handlebars and make the skateboard a scooter. Just because the handlebars don't attach to the older skateboard doesn't mean it's broken. It still works as a skateboard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Pickerings example, the handlebars are a feature that the browser may or may not support. Importantly, if there is no support for the feature, things <em>still work fine.</em> Great emphasis is placed on this point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The basic layout is not a broken layout.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's a provide example of a progressively enhanced masonry layout:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.grid</span> {\n\t<span class=\"hljs-attribute\">display</span>: grid;\n\t<span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-template-columns</span>: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">repeat</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">4</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>fr);\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">@supports</span> (<span class=\"hljs-attribute\">grid-template-rows:</span> masonry) {\n\t<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.grid</span> {\n\t\t<span class=\"hljs-attribute\">.grid-template-rows</span>: masonry;\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If a browser supports <code>@supports</code> and <code>grid-template-rows:masonry</code>, the layout engine applied the layout. The key here is that out layout tools are handling out layout, and Javascript is not relied on <em>at all</em> for functions that Javascript is not intended for.</p>\n<p>Another example, using <a href=\"https://github.com/Heydon/watched-box\"><watched-box></a> is provided:</p>\n<pre><code>// use web component\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">watched-box</span>\n\t<span class=\"hljs-attr\">widthBreaks</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;320px, 60ch&quot;</span>\n\t<span class=\"hljs-attr\">heightBreaks</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;100vh, 2014px&quot;</span> \n/&gt;</span>\n\t<span class=\"hljs-comment\">&lt;!-- children --&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">watched-box</span>&gt;</span>\n\n// progressive enhancement logic \nif (&#x27;ResizeObserver&#x27; in window &amp;&amp; &#x27;customElements&#x27; in window) {\n\tcustomElemeents.define(&#x27;watched-box&#x27;, WatchedBox);\n}\t\n\n// load custom element as module\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">type</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;module&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">src</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;watched-box.js&quot;</span>&gt;</span>&lt;/script\n</code></pre>\n<p>The module import self-selects for modern browsers, the custom element code itself checks for browser feature support, and if none of these things exist the children of the <code>&lt;watched-box&gt;</code> tag render normally.</p>\n<p>Another example of conditionally importing Javascript:</p>\n<pre><code>// ignored <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">by</span> old browsers, used <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">by</span> modern browsers\n<span class=\"xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">type</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;module&quot;</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">serc</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;new.js&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span>&gt;</span></span>\n\n\n// ignored <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">by</span> modern browsers, used <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">by</span> old browsers\n<span class=\"xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">nomodule</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">src</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;old.js&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">script</span>&gt;</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is all predicated on respecting the separation of concerns for HTML, CSS, and JS, and it's important that we don't do thing in JS that could and should be done with CSS.</p>\n<p>Pickering closes with a counter-example of regressive enhancement with a tab pattern. This pattern is better handled in a traditional HTML structure, as adding large amount of Javascript to collapse the pattern into tabs create both an accessibility and user experience nightmare that can be hugely difficult to untangle. Pickering identified the important of letting the browser technologies do their thing.</p>\n<p>The final note is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use Javascript to do Javascript things. And not Javascript to do like … not Javascript things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"What do we lose when it's easy to use?","slug":"pressman/medium-design","author":"Andy Pressman","year":2016,"source":"https://designportland.org/stories/2016/what-do-we-lose-when-its-easy-to-use","tags":"design","thesis":"The intentional creation of friction in an experience is an essential way to create experience and communicate values.","collection":"bibliography","timestamp":null},"content":"<p>Pressman runs a local design studio called Rumors. In 2015 they launched a new site that got a lot of critique on Designer News about its 'usability'.

I hate that it's squishy, poorly defined … all I can come to is &quot;ease of use&quot;.

He examines that web design has clear period styles which are tightly coupled to technological developments. Early web was focused on tables, due to the current tech. Then Bootstrap.css became a thing, and it moved quickly into its own period style. Bootstrap as a framework caused a development of a signature product style.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The more familiar the interface the less cognitive load … users grow accustomed to a set of behaviors … and take the desired action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did the user do the thing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pressman explores how the focus on conversions became the defining impulse to design decisions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Homogeneity reduces friction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Friction, and the desire to remove friction for the sake of conversions, drove a uniformity of a period style.</p>\n<p>Pressman offers an example from Speikermann who thinks the web should be alike a book – which is a classic Speikermann take.</p>\n<p>Pressman instead says that the web is a &quot;medium that we inhabit&quot; – and avoiding any friction &quot;reduces the medium to a series of consumer efficiencies.&quot; This reduction has strong similarities to the reduction of our current age – the deletion and removal of anything that doesn't immediately and efficiently serve the needs of capital.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The web is full of terrible, frustrating experiences … ease of use can and should be empowering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are some places – and functions of society – where ease of use is a powerful tool that <em>should</em> be prioritized.</p>\n<p>However, &quot;frictions and inefficiencies are the moments that slow us down&quot;. This means that <em>intentionally</em> creating friction, erecting a barrier to slow down the user before hitting the endpoint &quot;allows the user to process an experience rather than just consume it.&quot; Pressman quotes <a href=\"https://laurelschwulst.com/\">Laurel Schwulst</a> questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it specific?\nIs it memorable?\nDoes it turn idea into form?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Usability cannot be the <em>sole</em> criteria of of &quot;good&quot;, and these are a good starting place to expand our practice. Pressman adds a fourth:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does it benefit the user?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pressman notes that none of these preclude ease of use, but they do focus on experience rather than outcome. Pressman suggests that https://www.mcmaster.com/ is the very best website on the internet. I agree! This is an amazing site.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This response to the literacy of its users is what allows the site to be usable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pressman talk about the use style, which at its core is a vernacular language that allows you to efficiently speak to others that understand the same vernacular. This culls, rather than grows, an audience. Style performs the same function as jargon here, and acts as a way to attune a signal to a receiver. A reduction of the broadcast to the narrow-band communication.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brands depend on mental models of value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pressman talks about how the process of learning to use a difficult thing creates a sense of ownership. Pressman sees the value in creating and rewarding experience.</p>\n<p>Pressman gives the example of Printed Matter, and calls out that the deliberate introduction of friction can communicate a significant amount of <em>value</em> and <em>intention</em>. By creating friction in a certain way, by deliberately moving away from the frictionless standard, it invites the question of &quot;why did we do this?&quot;. If that question can be answered from a place of meaning, your values are communicated to the audience, and you can filter down a generic audience to a specific one that shares those values.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Meaning and form aren't just seen. Form is the behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This relates back to the fundamental stuff-ness of the web.</p>\n<p>The fourth point about benefit is about ethics – and creating a baseline ethical behavior for the interactions. This is the basic opening of web developments ethical compass: does it do what the user wants to do?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A dark pattern is frictionless design taken to its logical conclusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An example of how the shifting rubrics and definitions of &quot;good&quot; are fundamental to the execution and creation of any designed work. MetaFilter is a powerful example of creating a lot of friction <em>against</em> rapid growth. This creates a benefit for the broader community. Against twitter, it's clear where values lie and the ethical ramifications of sets of decisions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Frustration Threshold: How much friction can we add before it becomes frustration?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is directly correlated to the specificity of the users goals. When looking for a phone number or address, the threshold is very very low. It's also correlated to the scale of the audience, which maps back to the use of values as a filtering mechanism.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The more you understand of [the users needs] the more difficult and complex an experience you can build</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pressman ends the talk by framing the central question that he wants us to consider: Instead of &quot;How can I make everything easy to use?&quot; ask &quot;Just what components can be difficult?&quot;.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"collection":"bibliography","timestamp":null},"content":"<h1>Bibliography</h1>\n<p>{{TOC}}</p>\n<h2>Reading List</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>https://webaim.org/projects/million/#frameworks</li>\n<li>https://dev.to/richharris/in-defense-of-the-modern-web-2nia</li>\n<li>https://mxb.dev/blog/the-return-of-the-90s-web/</li>\n<li>https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2019-03-07-performance-budgets-that-stick/fro</li>\n<li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzGfBV67Tac&amp;feature=emb_title</li>\n<li>https://www.pcmaffey.com/roll-your-own-analytics/</li>\n<li>https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2018-07-05-what-kind-of-ethics-do-front-end-developers-need</li>\n<li>https://www.expertmarket.co.uk/web-design/ethical-responsibilities-web-developers-have</li>\n<li>https://www.okaloosaschools.com/fwb/sites/okaloosaschools.com.fwb/files/users/anthonybryant/wds_v1.1_ssg_l11.pdf</li>\n<li>https://edri.org/ethical-web-dev/</li>\n<li>https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/using-ethics-in-web-design/</li>\n<li>https://ethicalweb.org/</li>\n<li>https://paperswelove.org/2016/video/evelina-eric-ines-caitie/</li>\n<li>https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/from-0-to-insight-with-opentelemetry-in-go/</li>\n<li>https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/the-future-of-ops-jobs</li>\n<li>http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.html</li>\n<li>http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/</li>\n<li>https://www.eater.com/21398969/future-co-op-worker-owned-restaurants-ethical-business</li>\n<li>https://matthiasott.com/notes/how-i-structure-my-css</li>\n<li>https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/guide-to-cicd-for-frontend-developers</li>\n<li>https://www.viget.com/articles/web-brutalism-seamfulness-and-notion/</li>\n<li>https://cmhb.de/web-design-and-carbon-impact</li>\n<li>https://www.swyx.io/why-tailwind/</li>\n<li>https://blog.carlmjohnson.net/post/2020/web-components/</li>\n<li>https://lea.verou.me/2020/09/the-failed-promise-of-web-components/</li>\n<li>https://css-tricks.com/the-widening-responsibility-for-front-end-developers/</li>\n<li>https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/observability-101-terminology-and-concepts/</li>\n<li>https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/split-personality-brutalist-web-development/</li>\n<li>https://designportland.org/stories/2016/what-do-we-lose-when-its-easy-to-use</li>\n<li>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1013115.1013149</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tech Debt Singularity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>https://craigmod.com/essays/software_slump/</li>\n<li>http://workingwithdevs.com/technical-debt-singularity/</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Medium Design &amp; Dwarf Fortress</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro2/GameAIPro2_Chapter41_Simulation_Principles_from_Dwarf_Fortress.pdf</li>\n<li>https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/magazine/the-brilliance-of-dwarf-fortress.html</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"The Performance Inequality Gap","slug":"russel/the-performance-iniquality-gap","author":"Alex Russel","year":2021,"source":"https://infrequently.org/2021/03/the-performance-inequality-gap/","tags":"js, web, development","thesis":"When we construct the digital world to the limits of the best devices, we build a less usable one for the 80+% of the world's users.

Russel identifies that the experience of <em>being</em> on the web is about the whole experience, and any given slowdown in that experience creates a negative impression of the entire experience, raising the stakes of poor performance across the entire web ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Russel notes that baseline devices are getting better, but our bundle sizes continue to bloat.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Median mobile JavaScript payloads have only grown since 2016, now hovering above 400KiB of script transferred, or nearly 2.5MiB of uncompressed JS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Russel notes that browsers have gotten a lot better at unpacking and parsing JS:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The single largest improvements visible in traces come from improved parsing and off-thread compilation of JavaScript. This step-change, along with improvements to streaming compilation, has helped to ensure that users are less likely to notice the unreasonably-sized JS payloads that &quot;modern&quot; toolchains generate more often than not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We do end up inducing demand with these better systems: we build to fill the space we have. Russel notes that despite the JS off-thread improvements, main thread tasks (like DOM manipulation and layout paints) remain a significant challenge.</p>\n<p>Completely static sites with no requirement on JS for initial paint remains the gold standard in performance.</p>\n<p>Russel notes that the standard 3G network of 2017 left a very narrow margin for successfully loading a site in under 5 second:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The hard floor of that model (~1.6s) came from the contributions DNS, TCP/IP, and TLS connection setup over a then-reasonable 3G network baseline, leaving only 3400ms to work with, fighting Nagle and weak CPUs the whole way. Adding just one extra connection to a CDN for a critical path resource could sink the entire enterprise. Talk about a hard target.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>4G has become significantly more prevalent, especially across India. This raises the global baseline significantly due to the enormous number of users there, but raises questions about the state go 4G across African nations. <a href=\"https://www.opensignal.com/sites/opensignal-com/files/data/reports/pdf-only/data-2020-05/state_of_mobile_experience_may_2020_opensignal_3_0.pdf\">Open Signal</a> suggests that slow-is 4G everywhere is a reasonable assumption.</p>\n<p>Another problem with global baseline performance is the age of devices. These devices are a far, far cry from a recent or new iPhone. The Moto G4 remains a reasonable proxy for An Average Device. This remains unchanged since 2016, hence the articles thesis. The top-of-the-line models like my iPhone 11 are accelerating away from the global baseline of the Moto G4, creating a widening performance gap.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>low-end Androids have finally caught up to the iPhone 5 from 2012</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh god.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Things continue to get better and better for the wealthy, leaving the rest behind. When we construct a digital world to the limits of the best devices, the worse an experience we build, on average, for those who cannot afford iPhones or $800 Samsung flagships.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Russel transitions into a call to action framed in a moral imperative after noting that the landscape we're building into our devices mirrors the economic and political structures driving our world into the dust.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As frontenders, our task is to make services that work well for all, not just the wealthy … It's in that spirit that I find it important to build to a strawperson baseline device and network target. Such a benchmark serves as a stand-in until one gets situated data about a site or service's users, from whom we can derive informed conclusions about user needs and appropriate resource budgets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Russel notes that this is especially important for developers of libraries:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A global baseline is doubly important for generic frameworks and libraries, as they will be included in projects targeted at global-baseline users, whether or not developers have that in mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So buy a Moto G4 or a Moto E6 and test your projects on a 3G cellular network.</p>\n<p>Hitting 5s on these devices remains tricky, as a number of connections and efficiency of compiling and running JS can eat up lots of time and reduce the data cap.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That's a very fine point to balance on, though. A single additional TCP/TLS connection setup in the critical path reduces the amount by 100KiB (as do subsequent critical-path network handshakes) … In practice, you can't actually afford 600KiB of content if your application is build in the increasingly popular &quot;single page app&quot; style.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leads to the final summary of a budget.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conservatively then, assuming at least 2 connections need to be set up (burning ~1400 of our 5000ms), and that script resources are in the critical path, the new global baseline leaves space for ~100KiB (gzipped) of HTML/CSS/fonts and 300-350KiB of JavaScript on the wire (compressed). Critical path images for LCP, if any, need to subtract their transfer size from one of these buckets, with trades against JS bundle size potentially increasing total download budget, but the details matter a great deal. For &quot;modern&quot; pages, half a megabyte is a decent hard budget.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Russel ends optimistically, noting that the broader industry has gotten more serious about real user metrics and attempting to understand the real-world ecosystem across the globe, but calls out specifically the front-end industry professionals and suggests that we all need to put the health of the system before our own desire for comfort.</p>\n<p>This site — as of writing this annotation on 2021.03.12 — sends 166kB over the wire and decompresses to 301kB. JavaScript accounts for 62.2kB/188kB (over-the-wire/uncompressed) of that. Importantly, the site itself is completely static — the original page comes over the wire ready to view (with inlined CSS even). On an emulated Moto G4, Lighthouse gives us a time-to-interactive of 1.2s. This is almost entirely due to our use of <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a>, and the fact that the homepage has basically no interactions or content. The more involved pages like <a href=\"/bibliography\">the bibliography</a> and (an art page)[] clock a time-to-interactive of 2.9s and 1.1s respectively — but loading the image takes an incredible 8.3s, pulling down 1.2mB over the wire.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"There Really Is No Ethical Restaurant Under Capitalism","slug":"saxena/there-really-is-no-ethical-restaurant-under-capitalism","source":"https://www.eater.com/21398969/future-co-op-worker-owned-restaurants-ethical-business","author":"Jaya Saxena","year":2020,"tags":"food, ethics, work","thesis":"Building an equitable restaurant — where all workers are paid fairly, have benefits, and work without discrimination — will require undoing the way most restaurants are run","date":"2020.09.01","collection":"bibliography","timestamp":1598943600000},"content":"<blockquote>\n<p>TheThe only ethical restaurant I have ever heard of is on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saxena is is immediately concerned with the entire process of restaurant, and identifies that she's never even heard of a restaurant coming close to ethical outside of utopian fiction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Building an equitable restaurant, a place where all workers are paid fairly, have benefits, and can work in an anti-discriminatory environment, is going to take a near-undoing of the way most restaurants are run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This applies to companies and agencies that make the internet function as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Living in a country that provided universal health care, federally mandated paid child leave and sick leave, and a living minimum wage, as well as incentivized sustainable farming, encouraged unions, and got rid of at-will employment, would go a long way toward creating environments within restaurants (and all businesses) where workers had power over their own livelihood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, this applies to the basic functioning of how we build the internet. The structure <em>around</em> how we make what we make directly informs and is inextricable from what results and ethics of what we make.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…but Vartan continued to bring it up with employees, and eventually worked with Project Equity, an organization that advocates for and consults with companies to pivot to employee-owned models, to become a worker cooperative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Employee-owned companies are a step in the right direction. However, places like Amazon give their options stock options that vest. This is a common model for start-ups (Github).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Slice of New York allows employees to become co-owners after they’ve spent at least a year at the company; as of now, about 45 percent of the employees are co-owners.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However it sounds like having access to stocks and being a true ESOP like this Pizza Joint or Miller Paint is a different deal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The restaurant’s governance is what’s really affected: Every co-owner has an equal share of the business and a vote on a board. Board members all have an equal say in decisions about benefits, safety procedures, menu changes, and issues dealing with the general financial wellbeing of the company.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a revolutionary idea for the tech industry. This is what ethical starts to look like.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No matter how kindly run and community-focused a restaurant’s structure is, wages are often the sticking point. After all, it’s a job; getting paid is the goal. And as much as co-op or nonprofit structures help with the overall work culture, they do not solve the problem so many restaurants face: It costs money to pay people a living wage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reality is, even though Charmington’s is paying as much as it can while ensuring it can stay afloat, workers could probably make more elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does &quot;ethical&quot; need to be compromise in this way?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>… when it comes to restaurants, it’s hard to change one thing unless you’re changing everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are systemic forces at work that prevent any individual, or even any small community from truly reaching a place of ethical behavior. This makes me think that there has to be a split between &quot;acting ethically&quot; and &quot;being ethical&quot;. We can all act ethically, working our way upstream against the system forces arrayed against us, but that's no guarantee that we will, at the end of the day, be ethical.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of course, not every meal can realistically be $195 per person. The cost of providing every employee with a living wage and benefits — not to mention paying rent and insurance, and serving a good product affordable enough for most people — is nearly impossible with the way restaurants, co-op or not, must run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why is this? We live in a time of unprecedented efficiency, unbelievable abundance, and massive wealth but if a <em>restaurant</em> is called to truly account for its exploitation to charge its true price, it's immediately untenable. This feels like it must be true across many industries – Uber would rather cease service in California than treat it's drivers like employees. What would it take to truly understand what the network of costs, values, debts, and the real price of things?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem of “good” food being prohibitively expensive can’t be completely solved by restaurateurs turning those knobs. Depressed wages and inflation are problems for everyone, not just restaurant workers</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are those really two issues at work? I get the sense that those are both symptoms of an underlying disconnection between labor &amp; resources and consumption.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now, “value” can include not just customer experience, but the knowledge that employee well-being is part of the plan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is that a value add?? Are we now just selling ethical choices, and letting the concept of the market determine how we can work? Because than we're just playing the same game with the rich being able to &quot;choose&quot; ethical consumption methods and purchase the ability to do the right thing, which absolves them of responsibility to change the system and support systemic reform. I guess this is the classic reform vs revolution problem, and the source of revolutionaries attacking reformers for making a broken system more bearable instead of truly fixing it. Again tho – the system isn't broken but designed. Getting out of that polemic means identifying the design.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But everything restaurants can do on their own is a few drops in a bucket compared to what government support in the form of things like universal health care, or real aid for small businesses, could achieve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thats the dream that articulated by Star Trek – government entities who have the ability to make real change <em>do</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sustained change will take a greater understanding of what “equity” means, and what it will require from both restaurants and customers. As bad as the pandemic has been, it has put us in a great position to do that sort of reevaluation, and reimagine a restaurant as a place where success doesn’t mean profit, but rather that the whole community, farm-to-table, is cared for. And to maybe even fight for a day when it won’t be the responsibility of restaurants to solve these problems at all</p>\n</blockquote>\n"}]
