Viewport Grid puts less columns on small screen, and more columns on large screens. A column becomes a standard unit of measurement, creating a constant and abstracted grid system that stands behind the content of a page rather than within it.</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img\n          class=\"figure-image lazyload\"\n          src=\"/180x180/introduction.png\"\n          data-optimumx=\"1.6\"\n          data-src=\"/{width}x5000/introduction.png\"\n          data-sizes=\"auto\"\n          alt=\"Viewport Grid\" />\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<h4>Why We Did It</h4>\n<p>Original designed to address the needs of the  <a href=\"http://esri.github.io/calcite-web/\">Calcite Web</a> grid system, Viewport Grid was developed independently in order to expose it's value to other, non-calcite projects.</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img\n          class=\"figure-image lazyload\"\n          src=\"/180x180/collapsed.png\"\n          data-optimumx=\"1.6\"\n          data-src=\"/{width}x5000/collapsed.png\"\n          data-sizes=\"auto\"\n          alt=\"Viewport Grid\" />\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<h4>Why It's Interesting:</h4>\n<p>Grid theory in graphic design for print applications differs from established methods for using grids in CSS. Viewport Grid works to create a system where the classic grid design techniques can be used on the web, meaning a closer connection between the 'page' and the 'screen.'</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img\n          class=\"figure-image lazyload\"\n          src=\"/180x180/responsive-columns.png\"\n          data-optimumx=\"1.6\"\n          data-src=\"/{width}x5000/responsive-columns.png\"\n          data-sizes=\"auto\"\n          alt=\"Viewport Grid\" />\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img\n          class=\"figure-image lazyload\"\n          src=\"/180x180/responsive.png\"\n          data-optimumx=\"1.6\"\n          data-src=\"/{width}x5000/responsive.png\"\n          data-sizes=\"auto\"\n          alt=\"Viewport Grid\" />\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<p>Viewport Grid puts less columns on small screen, and more columns on large screens.
