Each page as a unique colorway in reference to the season glazes (configurable for each section from the Shopify Admin interface), and they images are a gray-scaled and multiplied over the background color. On hover, the image transitions to a full-color treatment. Animating the transition between these sates is tricky – CSS blend modes cannot be transitioned as they are binary states. The effect is achieved by having <em>two</em> images, one with the multiply &amp; grayscale, and one full-color but transparent positioned above it. On hover, the opacity of the top image is transitioned, providing the desired effect.</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"Portland Transporation System Plan","slug":"portland-transportation-system-plan","site":"http://pbot-tsp.surge.sh","date":"2017.05.20","description":"<p>Design &amp; Development of public policy &amp; GIS data presenting the City of Portlands plans for 20 years of public works development.

Paul learned the game quick and soon was playing at my level (and slightly above!). We played over lunch, and one day when we were both working from home rather than the office, we decided to see what was out there for playing online.</p>\n<p>While there are some amazing servers out there for playing Go like <a href=\"https://online-go.com/\">Online Go</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gokgs.com/\">KGS</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.tygembaduk.com/\">Tygem Baduk</a>, they all required a significant amount of set up, investment, and it was tricky for us to just pick up a game with each other right away. What we needed was a Go server where one player could send a URL to the other and start playing.</p>\n<p>So we built that!</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img\n          class=\"figure-image lazyload\"\n          src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Joseki-party/i-StZmkMS/0/4fb63fac/180x180/title-X3.png\"\n          data-optimumx=\"1.6\"\n          data-src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Joseki-party/i-StZmkMS/0/4fb63fac/{width}x5000/title-X3.png\"\n          data-sizes=\"auto\"\n          alt=\"Title Screen for Joseki Party\" />\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<h3>The Big Idea</h3>\n<p>We had a couple of hard requirements for the project, which shaped a lot of our design decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>No Auth:</strong> We wanted to avoid any sort of user account management — no creating accounts, no signing in, no OAuth with Twitter or Facebook so you can share post your game points. This was going to be about zero-friction Go. Any set up where a user has to do anything beyond start playing when they got a link was off the table.</p>\n<p><strong>No Server:</strong> Paul and I are front-end types — we both know plenty of NodeJS but dislike writing servers. This was going to be pure client-side.</p>\n<p><strong>No Framework:</strong> There's been a <em>lot</em> of discourse about the state of JavaScript frameworks in 2016. And after using any number of different frameworks for any number of projects (and one notable example of 4 frameworks in <em>one</em> project) I thought we could experiment with <a href=\"http://vanilla-js.com/\">Vanills JS</a> and see where that landed us.</p>\n<p><strong>Live:</strong> It's a game, so we decided it should feel as close as possible to sitting down and playing a game. We wanted to avoid browser refreshes, notifications, and things of that nature. When you play, your opponent sees the move. When your opponent plays, you see the move.</p>\n<p><strong>MVI Loops:</strong> A major part of the project was getting deep into the practicalities of writing <a href=\"http://staltz.com/unidirectional-user-interface-architectures.html\">unidirectional applications</a> with a Model → View → Intent system.</p>\n<p><strong>A New Visual Language:</strong> One of my major design interests is in the translation between the analog and the digital. I wanted to take the same approach to the aesthetics of Go — attempt the keep the striking nature of the game itself but ditch any attempt at skeuomorphism that pervades practically <em>all</em> of the computer Go programs I've ever played on.</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img\n          class=\"figure-image lazyload\"\n          src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Joseki-party/i-dwf5h8p/0/ca9e4700/180x180/new-game-X3.png\"\n          data-optimumx=\"1.6\"\n          data-src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Joseki-party/i-dwf5h8p/0/ca9e4700/{width}x5000/new-game-X3.png\"\n          data-sizes=\"auto\"\n          alt=\"Starting a New Game\" />\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<h3>Solutions</h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a></strong> solved a lot of our problems with the practicalities of a shared, live game state without using a server.

Esri's <em>design</em> team however, is based in the Redlands, California mother-ship. This meant that a lot of the design tools created for Esri's web presence were unevenly distributed across the huge number of teams who needed to develop web properties.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http://pdx.esri.com/\">Esri PDX R&amp;D</a> we had <a href=\"http://paulcpederson.com/\">assembled</a> a <a href=\"http://patrickarlt.com/\">strong</a> <a href=\"http://ungoldman.com/\">team</a> of designer/developers. We sat down to create a design system that we could distribute to <em>all</em> of Esri's development teams, with the goal of creating a unified user experience for all our customers, and keeping all of our properties aligned and in sync as we moved forward.</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img\n          class=\"figure-image lazyload\"\n          src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Calcite-web/i-ddZ8k6m/0/e1ea0445/180x180/examples-doc-X3.png\"\n          data-optimumx=\"1.6\"\n          data-src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Calcite-web/i-ddZ8k6m/0/e1ea0445/{width}x5000/examples-doc-X3.png\"\n          data-sizes=\"auto\"\n          alt=\"Calcite Web Examples\" />\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<h2>Goals</h2>\n<p>Building a design library and CSS framework can be a complicated affair, made more complicated by the large audience of developers we had to make the project work for.</p>\n<p><strong>Adoption:</strong> We had to make the framework incredibly attractive to Esri developers, and incredible easy for them to use. Our main goal was unification, so any barriers to adoption needed to be removed.</p>\n<p><strong>Composabillity:</strong> To this end, we needed using the framework to be as simple is including a CSS file and copy-pasting code samples.</p>\n<p><strong>Modularity:</strong> Many of the projects at Esri have rigid, preexisting code bases and technologies that we needed to integrate smoothly with — we needed to provide a system that works in whatever tech stack it finds itself in.</p>\n<p><strong>No Opinions:</strong> We wanted the framework to provide a full set of interactive patterns — requiring JavaScript — but also work in any JavaScript framework environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Robust:</strong> Certain aspects of the framework — like <a href=\"/projects/viewport-grid\">the grid system</a> had major functional requirements. The grid itself needed to be column based, fully responsive by default, and work down to IE 8.</p>\n<p><strong>Flexible:</strong> Developers needed to have access to a wide range of patterns, ensuring that common structures didn't get independently invented in different projects. Designers needed to have the freedom to create on-off pages that stood out without feeling constricted.</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img\n          class=\"figure-image lazyload\"\n          src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Calcite-web/i-RtQW5gB/0/e5bee077/180x180/patterns-doc-X3.png\"\n          data-optimumx=\"1.6\"\n          data-src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Calcite-web/i-RtQW5gB/0/e5bee077/{width}x5000/patterns-doc-X3.png\"\n          data-sizes=\"auto\"\n          alt=\"Calcite Web Patterns\" />\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<h2>Using Sass</h2>\n<p>Sass — through the <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\">Node Sass project</a> allowed us to meet many of our goals. A major theoretical underpinning to the framework's .SCSS involved making the specificity graph as flat as possible, and decoupling style code from selectors. This allows the design code to be reused and adapted basically anywhere in any given project.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">@mixin</span> tab-contents() {\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">@include</span> box-sizing(border-box);\n  <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">border</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1px</span> solid <span class=\"hljs-variable\">$lighter-gray</span>;\n  <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">margin-top</span>: -<span class=\"hljs-number\">1px</span>;\n}\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">@if</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">$include-tabs</span> == true {\n <span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.tab-section</span> { <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">@include</span> tab-section(); }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The CSS development principles are outlined in <a href=\"http://paulcpederson.com/articles/css-for-people-who-hate-css/\">an excellent article (and Esri User Conference presentation) by Paul Pederson.</a></p>\n<h2>JavaScript, or Not</h2>\n<p>All of our interactive patterns require a <code>.js-</code> prefix hook to bind JS events too. This lets projects using <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\">Angular</a> or <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a> to write their own component code for the interactions while still getting all the canonical design code for a pattern.</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img\n          class=\"figure-image lazyload\"\n          src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Calcite-web/i-nJkf5G2/0/abe4593b/180x180/event-bus-doc-X3.png\"\n          data-optimumx=\"1.6\"\n          data-src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Calcite-web/i-nJkf5G2/0/abe4593b/{width}x5000/event-bus-doc-X3.png\"\n          data-sizes=\"auto\"\n          alt=\"Calcite Web Patterns\" />\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<p>The JS portion of the framework uses Publication / Subscription event bus to connect user intent and component behavior. This allows for programmatic control of the UI, and lets a pattern communicate to the rest of the application. The JavaScript library is written as a set of ES6 modules, and is compiled to an ES5 UMD module, attaching itself to the <code>window</code> on load.</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img\n          class=\"figure-image lazyload\"\n          src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Calcite-web/i-npTCL4g/0/705a3306/180x180/color-doc-X3.png\"\n          data-optimumx=\"1.6\"\n          data-src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Projects/Calcite-web/i-npTCL4g/0/705a3306/{width}x5000/color-doc-X3.png\"\n          data-sizes=\"auto\"\n          alt=\"Calcite Web Grayscale\" />\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<h2>The Brand</h2>\n<p>Color and Typography do most of the heavy lifting when communicated brand identity on the Web. We developed a gray scale, and selected a limited set of colors from the immense set of <a href=\"https://github.com/Esri/calcite-colors\">Esri's color pallete</a> to expose as simple color classes and variables. We updated the typography to Avenir NExt by Adrian Frutiger and Akira Kobayashi to give Esri's classic Avenir print style a boost that it needed for screen display.</p>\n<p>\n    <figure
