Install <a href=\"https://nanobox.io/\">this thing</a> and con­nect it to your ac­count on <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\">here</a>. Buy a li­cense of <a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/\">this (it’s worth it)</a>. Read some docs for <a href=\"https://www.upstatement.com/timber/\">this</a> and start build­ing. Wordpress 5 and Gutenberg will prob­a­bly break all of this ex­cept the en­vi­ron­ments.</p>\n<p>When I ﬁrst started work­ing as a de­vel­oper, Wordpress was <em>the</em> preva­lent plat­form for pretty much any pro­ject. Ten years later and … Wordpress is still pretty much most of the in­ter­net. In gen­eral, Wordpress will be my last choice of a plat­form. I pre­fer to build sta­tic sites, use a head­less <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span>, or al­most any­thing else at all.</p>\n<p>That said, as the Technical Director at Fuzzco — a de­sign stu­dio that re­lies al­most ex­clu­sively on Wordpress for their web­sites — Wordpress was hap­pen­ing. Fuzzco is rare among stu­dios in that we man­age and host pro­jects for our clients, and of­ten have main­te­nance rid­ers that can last for years. This means that in the course of a year, not only did we build a half dozen new pro­jects on Wordpress, but we main­tained and triaged is­sues on over 100 legacy pro­jects.</p>\n<p>Very quickly I re­al­ized I had one op­tion: <em>make Wordpress not ter­ri­ble.</em></p>\n<h2>Terrible is pretty harsh</h2>\n<p>If you’re com­fort­able with Wordpress, you might ﬁnd some ﬁght­in’ words here. What’s my prob­lem with Wordpress and what am I try­ing to solve for? My biggest is­sue with Wordpress de­vel­op­ment as I’ve en­coun­tered it in the past is a lack of clar­ity around the re­quire­ments of the en­tire sys­tem. What does the pro­ject need to run in an en­vi­ron­ment, and why? How do we move from a repos­i­tory to a lo­cal en­vi­ron­ment and start work­ing on a code­base? How does that code­base get de­ployed to a server?</p>\n<p>I’ve seen Wordpress sys­tems that are frozen in time in 2006 — <span class=\"small-caps\">FTP</span> to the server and edit a <span class=\"small-caps\">CSS</span> ﬁle on pro­duc­tion, or<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>deploy” your theme by up­load­ing a <code>.zip</code>. I’m in­ter­ested in how we can lower the cog­ni­tive over­head for get­ting a Wordpress pro­ject up and run­ning, and join in with pre-pro­cess­ing, com­pil­ing, con­tainer­iz­ing, test­ing, and all the re­ally ex­cel­lent things that we’ve come to ex­pect from our web stacks over the past few years.</p>\n<p>Another is­sue I have with Wordpress is its com­mit­ment to auto-mag­i­cal routes and ren­der­ing tem­plates with ob­scure and com­pli­cated <code>.php</code> pat­terns that ba­si­cally con­cate­nate strings. I’m in­ter­ested in ex­plicit routes — ei­ther hard-coded or pa­ra­me­ter­ized — and sep­a­rat­ing con­cerns be­tween logic and tem­plate.</p>\n<p>A lot of this boils down to a dis­agree­ment be­tween what Wordpress thinks a site should be and what I end up us­ing it for. Wordpress as de­signed dis­tin­guishes be­tween your<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>site” and your<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>theme”. Your<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>site” is the con­tent in the data­base, the op­tions you’ve saved, and the menus and wid­gets you’ve in­stalled. It ex­pects<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>themes” to be pre­sen­ta­tions of this real web­site stuff. This model of web­sites per­pet­u­ates that<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>design” is some­thing that can be ap­plied over a web­site, a kind of dress­ing up of the real things. This is the in­verse, and per­haps a corol­lary to, the con­cept that de­sign­ing a web­site is just de­cid­ing what it looks like. It’s an idea that lives within the sys­tem of si­los be­tween de­sign and de­vel­op­ment, and that we can<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>design” a web­site in Photoshop or Sketch and hand off the comps to a de­vel­oper to build it. Which is how a lot of Wordpress pro­jects are built.</p>\n<p>In short, <a href=\"/texts/how-to-design-while-developing/\">I dis­agree</a> with this con­cept of web­sites. My po­si­tion is that de­sign­ing a web­site is both how it looks, how it works, and how the data and struc­tures are com­posed. Taking this ap­proach, con­trol­ling the ob­ject mod­els, the in­for­ma­tion ar­chi­tec­tures, and the tem­plates are all of equal im­por­tance. In my line of work, a Wordpress theme can not be ap­plied to any other site than the one that it was de­signed for, a site where the struc­ture was de­signed for the theme.</p>\n<h2>So why use Wordpress?</h2>\n<p>There are still a num­ber of re­ally good, com­pelling rea­sons to use Wordpress as a plat­form for build­ing web­sites. It’s got a ro­bust built-in com­ment­ing sys­tem with user ac­counts. It’s re­ally good for things that are shaped like blogs. It’s got a huge, well-main­tained ecosys­tem of plu­g­ins. It’s free. And since it’s most of the Internet, clients are re­ally, re­ally com­fort­able with it.</p>\n<p>There are a cou­ple of rea­sons <em>not</em> to use Wordpress right now. Mostly these cen­ter around the im­pend­ing re­lease of Wordpress 5.0 and the Gutenberg ed­i­tor, which has a num­ber of con­cerns around plu­gin com­pat­i­bil­ity and ac­ces­si­bil­ity for au­thors.</p>\n<p>But that’s okay, since we’ve de­cided to use Wordpress 4.x. As we all know, pick­ing a ver­sion of Wordpress and then never up­grad­ing it is one of the time hon­ored tra­di­tions of Wordpress de­vel­op­ment.</p>\n<h2>How does this work even</h2>\n<p>Let’s start at the end.</p>\n<p>We’re go­ing to be host­ing our pro­duc­tion Wordpress site on a <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\">Digital Ocean</a> droplet — the <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/\">small­est</a> one they have — for $5 per month. Depending on the pro­ject life­cy­cle, we can set up more droplets for a stag­ing server and a de­vel­op­ment server. At Fuzzco we used dev servers to show sites to the in­ter­nal team, stag­ing servers to show sites to the client, and pro­duc­tion servers to show sites to the pub­lic.</p>\n<p>I don’t know about you, but I per­son­ally don’t su­per love man­ag­ing my vir­tual pri­vate servers man­u­ally. In or­der to de­ploy our code­bases to Digital Ocean we’ll use the phe­nom­e­nal tool <a href=\"https://nanobox.io/\">Nanobox</a>. Nanobox is an op­er­a­tions layer that han­dles con­tainer­iz­ing ap­pli­ca­tions and de­ploy­ing them ag­nos­ti­cally to a cloud ser­vice provider. Nanobox will de­ploy our code from the com­mand line to any one of our droplets.</p>\n<p>Nanobox will also con­tainer­ize and run an ap­pli­ca­tion in a vir­tual ma­chine <em>lo­cally</em>. This means we’ll use it to run our de­vel­op­ment en­vi­ron­ment, and en­sure that all of our en­vi­ron­ments are iden­ti­cal. No more wor­ry­ing about <span class=\"small-caps\">PHP</span> ver­sions and ex­ten­sions and plu­g­ins. No more run­ning <span class=\"small-caps\">MAMP</span> or MySQL or Apache or what­ever on your lo­cal ma­chine be­fore any­thing works. Nanobox de­ﬁnes the server in a <code>.yaml</code> ﬁle, and it will al­ways be the same. It also han­dles all the sync­ing be­tween our lo­cal disk and our vir­tual en­vi­ron­ment.</p>\n<p>So now that we know how our code is go­ing from lo­cal to pro­duc­tion, we can think for a sec­ond about <em>how</em> it’s go­ing to do that, and how we’re go­ing to man­age our data.</p>\n<p>The data­base on the pro­duc­tion server is<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>canonical”. That means that the data­base the client in­ter­acts with is the one true data­base, and we must treat it with care and at­ten­tion. We’ll never change that data­base our­selves, and we’ll move that data­base <em>down­stream</em> from pro­duc­tion to stag­ing to dev to lo­cal in or­der to de­velop against our real data. Importantly, we don’t want to mi­grate the data­base man­u­ally ei­ther. It’s a lit­tle ex­pen­sive but us­ing <a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/pricing/\">Migrate <span class=\"small-caps\">DB</span> Pro</a> is an in­cred­i­ble re­source for this part. I guess one could also look into <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db\">al­ter­na­tives</a> for per­sonal pro­jects.</p>\n<p>The canon­i­cal <em>code­base</em> lives in ver­sion con­trol, and moves the other di­rec­tion. From Github to lo­cal to dev to stag­ing to pro­duc­tion, amen. The only things we need to track in ver­sion con­trol are what makes our pro­ject unique. Practically, this means we need to track our theme and our plu­g­ins. Wordpress core ﬁles are not spe­cial, and we should not ﬁll our repos­i­to­ries with them.</p>\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\n<p>At this point it’s worth <a href=\"https://docs.nanobox.io/install/\">get­ting started with Nanobox</a>. I back the con­tain­ers with <a href=\"https://docs.nanobox.io/install/#lightweight-vm-virtualbox\">VirtualBox</a>, since at the time I started this it was slightly more sta­ble than Docker on MacOS High Sierra. Once Nanobox &amp; Virtualbox/Docker is in­stalled, set up <a href=\"https://docs.nanobox.io/providers/hosting-accounts/digitalocean/\">Digital Ocean as your provider</a>. Once that’s done, we have every­thing we need to get started!</p>\n<p>I’ll be talk­ing through a pro­ject I built in or­der to fa­cil­i­tate build­ing other pro­jects. This will be more in­tense than you might need for a sin­gle build, but this was de­signed a tool that any­one can use to get started quickly. Here’s the ba­sic struc­ture of our repo:</p>\n<pre><code>📁 <span class=\"hljs-string\">/project-name</span>\n⮑ 📄 <span class=\"hljs-string\">.gitignore</span>    <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># includes /wp</span>\n⮑ 📄 package.json  <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># tooling lives here</span>\n⮑ 📄 readme.md     <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># be nice, write docs    </span>\n⮑ 📁 theme         <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># our theme codebase</span>\n⮑ 📁 plugins       <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># vendor plugins</span>\n⮑ 📁 scripts       <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># some helpers</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The crux of the pro­ject is our <code>boxfile.yml</code> con­ﬁg­u­ra­tion ﬁle.

This will hold all the Wordpress core ﬁles and com­piled theme code, none of of which we need or want in ver­sion con­trol. As such, make sure this is listed along­side <code>node_modules</code> in the <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>\n<p>Since we’ve de­cided that we don’t want to track these ﬁles, but we need them to ac­tu­ally have a pro­ject, we can write a helper script to take care of the gap be­tween those two ideas.</p>\n<p>Here are the scripts we’re go­ing to write to help us han­dle this process:</p>\n<pre><code>📁 /<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">project</span>-name\n⮑ 📁 scripts\n   ⮑ 📄 check-<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">install</span>.sh <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Installs Wordpress core files.</span>\n   ⮑ 📄 init.sh          <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Runs our setup helper.</span>\n   ⮑ 📄 prestart.sh      <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Checks if we need to init.</span>\n   ⮑ 📄 setup.js         <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># Cute lil&#x27; CLI helper.</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The ﬁrst thing we’ll do is write a script that checks if <code>/wp</code> ex­ists. If it does­n’t, throw an er­ror that we need to ini­tial­ize the pro­ject since we don’t have any of the core ﬁles we need.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\"># prestart.sh</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">#!/bin/bash</span>\necho <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;Check to make sure wordpress is here at all&#x27;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> test -d .<span class=\"hljs-regexp\">/wp/</span>\nthen\n  echo <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;yup we good&#x27;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">exit</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">else</span>\n  echo <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;Project not initialized: Run `$ npm run init`&#x27;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">exit</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\nfi\n</code></pre>\n<p>I’m call­ing this <code>prestart</code> be­cause I want to run it be­fore <code>npm start</code>. Many times I’ll be on au­topi­lot, and af­ter cloning a repo sim­ply run <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm start</code>. This in­ter­rupts that process and lets me know I need a third step, <code>npm run init</code>. Let’s put this in our <code>package.json</code> scripts:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\"># package.json</span>\n{\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;scripts&quot;</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;init&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;./scripts/init.sh&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;prestart&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;./scripts/prestart.sh&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;start&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;npm run dev&quot;</span>\n  }\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span>\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We’ll get to our dev tool­ing later. Lets take a look at what our <code>init.sh</code> script does:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\"># init.sh</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">#!/bin/bash</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">node</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">./scripts</span>/setup.js  \n</code></pre>\n<p>Not much! This just runs our setup <span class=\"small-caps\">CLI</span> helper. You might not need all this, but since I built this sys­tem to help a team of de­vel­op­ers work on <em>many many</em> pro­jects you’re gonna get it any­way.</p>\n<pre><code><span

The biggest dif­fer­ence is the bit where we use <code>degit</code> to clone Nanobox’s of­ﬁ­cial Wordpress repo into our un­tracked <code>/wp</code> di­rec­tory. Degit will only get the head ﬁles, and none of the git his­tory. Nor will it keep the <code>.git</code> ﬁle, ba­si­cally mak­ing this a su­per clean, su­per fast way to down­load a di­rec­tory of ﬁles. It’s great. The last thing this does is wipe out any themes or plu­g­ins that we don’t want our need in the core ﬁles and syncs out own tracked di­rec­to­ries to the cor­rect places in the Wordpress core ﬁle struc­ture.</p>\n<p>Now would be a time to talk about plu­g­ins.</p>\n<h2>What’s up with plu­g­ins?</h2>\n<p>Wordpress has a mil­lion plu­g­ins. We’re go­ing to fo­cus on some of the ba­sic ones that al­most every Wordpress pro­ject ever needs, and should hon­estly be part of Wordpress. Building sites with­out these is a pain. Here they are:</p>\n<pre><code>📁 /project-name\n⮑ 📁 plugins\n  ⮑ 📁 advanced-custom-fields-<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">pro</span>\n  ⮑ 📁 custom-<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">post</span>-types-ui\n  ⮑ 📁 timber-library\n  ⮑ 📁 wp-migrate-<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">db</span>-<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">pro</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are a cou­ple more in my repo to do things like or­der posts in the <span class=\"small-caps\">CMS</span> and im­port CSVs. Not su­per nec­es­sary, so we won’t talk about theme here.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Custom Fields</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\"><span class=\"small-caps\">ACF</span></a> is a sta­ple of Wordpress de­vel­op­ment. It lets us de­ﬁne new key/​value pairs to ex­tend the data model of things like posts and pages, and al­lows us to cre­ate a set of global vari­able avail­able from any­where. Sounds sim­ple, sur­pris­ing it’s not part of Wordpress.</p>\n<h3>Custom Post Types <span class=\"small-caps\">UI</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/\">CPT-UI</a> cre­ates an in­ter­face in the ad­min panel for cre­at­ing new post types. Out of the box, Wordpress comes with <code>Posts</code> and <code>Pages</code>. CPT-UI lets us build new types like <code>Projects</code> or <code>Case Studies</code> or what­ever need for our data model. Again, sur­pris­ing that this  is­n’t just part of Wordpress. C’est la vivre.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"small-caps\">WP</span> Migrate <span class=\"small-caps\">DB</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/\">Migrate <span class=\"small-caps\">DB</span></a> lets us … mi­grate … our … <span class=\"small-caps\">DB</span>. This gives us the abil­ity to sync our data­bases across en­vi­ron­ments and get me­dia up­loads and things with­out need­ing to write magic MySQL queries while tun­neled into open data­base ports on vir­tual ma­chines. This is bet­ter. Believe me.</p>\n<h3>Timber</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.upstatement.com/timber/\">Timber</a> li­brary from Upstatement is the great­est thing to hap­pen to Wordpress de­vel­op­ment, af­ter those plu­g­ins that should just be part of Wordpress. Timber in­tro­duces the con­cept of <em>lay­out tem­plates</em> to Wordpress. This lets us write <span class=\"small-caps\">PHP</span> to ma­nip­u­late data, and pass that data to a tem­plate ﬁle where we can write <a href=\"https://twig.symfony.com/\">Twig tem­plates</a> rather than com­pos­ing strings in <span class=\"small-caps\">PHP</span>. Basically …</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span> $myvar <span class=\"hljs-meta\">?&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Turns in to:</p>\n<p>{% raw %}</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-template-variable\">{{ <span class=\"hljs-name\">myvar</span> }}</span><span class=\"xml\">\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>{% en­draw %}</p>\n<p>This lets us write tem­plates with a tem­plat­ing lan­guage, and write server-side busi­ness logic in a server-side pro­gram­ming lan­guage. Truly rev­o­lu­tion­ary.</p>\n<h2>What we talk about when we talk about Wordpress de­vel­op­ment: or, The Theme.</h2>\n<p>With all this ini­tial work around Wordpress core, de­vel­op­ment en­vi­ron­ments, and a ba­sic plu­gin ecosys­tem in place we can start talk­ing about the good stuff: the theme!</p>\n<pre><code>📁 /project-name\n⮑ 📁 theme\n   ⮑ 📁 es6              # Source JS\n   ⮑ 📁 scss             # Source SCSS\n   ⮑ 📁 routes           # PHP<span class=\"hljs-built_in\"> route </span>logic files\n      ⮑ 📄 index.php\n      ⮑ 📄 page.php\n      ⮑ 📄 post.php\n   ⮑ 📁 views            # Twig templates\n      ⮑ 📁 layouts\n      ⮑ 📁 pages\n      ⮑ 📁 partials\n   ⮑ 📄 functions.php    # This includes routing.\n   ⮑ 📄 screenshot.png   # Theme preview image.\n   ⮑ 📄 index.php        # Need this, but it<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;s empty.¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>We won’t get too deep into this, since we’re get­ting into more con­ven­tional ter­ri­tory here. Basically our <code>es6</code> di­rec­tory holds source <span class=\"small-caps\">JS</span> that will get com­piled into a bun­dle. Same with the <code>scss</code> di­rec­tory, which gets com­piled into css. We han­dle that with npm scripts in the <code>package.json</code>.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\"># package.json</span>\n{\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;scripts&quot;</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;css&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;node-sass ./theme/scss/style.scss theme/style.css --watch&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;js&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;rollup -c -w&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span>\n  }\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span>\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hopefully none of this is to un­usual — if it’s is I rec­om­mend read­ing Paul Pederson’s <a href=\"http://paulcpederson.com/articles/npm-run/\">ex­cel­lent ar­ti­cle on npm scripts</a>.</p>\n<p>There is one part of this I want to touch on be­fore mov­ing on:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\"># package.json</span>\n{\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;scripts&quot;</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;sync:plugins&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;rsync -va --delete ./plugins/ ./wp/wp-content/plugins/&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;sync:theme&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;rsync -va --delete ./theme/ ./wp/wp-content/themes/fuzzco&quot;</span>,    \n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;watch&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;rerun-script&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span>\n  },\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;watches&quot;</span>: {\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;sync:plugins&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;plugins/**/*.*&quot;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;sync:theme&quot;</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">&quot;theme/**/*.*&quot;</span>\n  },\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">...</span> \n</code></pre>\n<p>This bit sets up a watcher on our <code>theme</code> and <code>plugins</code> di­rec­tory, which sync our tracked work­ing ﬁles to the cor­rect place in our Wordpress core ﬁle struc­ture.</p>\n<h2>Functions, Routes, and Views</h2>\n<p>The last thing I want to touch on is the ba­sic struc­ture of us­ing Timber to match routes with views.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\">/** functions.php */</span>\nRoutes::map(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;/&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">$params</span>)</span>{\n  Routes::load(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;routes/page.php&#x27;</span>, $params, <span class=\"hljs-literal\">null</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">200</span>);\n});\nRoutes::map(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;/:page&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"hljs-params\">$params</span>) </span>{\n  $page = get_page_by_path($params[<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;page&#x27;</span>]);\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ($page) {\n      Routes::load(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;routes/page.php&#x27;</span>, $params, <span class=\"hljs-literal\">null</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">200</span>);\n  } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">else</span> {\n      Routes::load(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;routes/404.php&#x27;</span>, $params, <span class=\"hljs-literal\">null</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">404</span>);\n  }\n});\nRoutes::map(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;/blog/:post&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">$params</span>)</span>{\n  Routes::load(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;routes/post.php&#x27;</span>, $params, <span class=\"hljs-literal\">null</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">200</span>);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>These are Timber routes de­ﬁned in the <code>functions.php</code> ﬁle. This re­places the stan­dard rout­ing of Wordpress, and we have change the struc­ture of the Wordpress perma­links to any­thing other than the de­fault to have it work. This is doc­u­mented in Timber.</p>\n<p>When our server gets a re­quest at a route of <code>/page-name</code>, it will call the <code>page.php</code> ﬁle and pass it the params as­so­ci­ated with the route.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-comment\">/** page.php */</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span>\n  $context = Timber::get_context();\n  $post = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> TimberPost();\n  $context[<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;page&#x27;</span>] = $post;\n  \n  Timber::render( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">array</span>(\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;views/pages/page-&#x27;</span> . $post-&gt;post_name . <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;.twig&#x27;</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;views/pages/page.twig&#x27;</span>\n  ), $context );\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">?&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>page.php</code> ﬁle as­signs some vari­ables, in­ter­acts with Wordpress to get and shape our data, and then ren­ders the twig ﬁle as­so­ci­ated with the page.

Maybe it’s a sim­ple hello world, maybe it’s a heavy duty big ol’ thing. Either way, it’s time to de­ploy.</p>\n<p>You can use Nanobox to cre­ate a droplet for your server. Nanobox will give your pro­ject a name in their sys­tem, and ex­pose the <span class=\"small-caps\">URL</span> for the server at <code>&lt;your-project&gt;.nanoapp.io</code>. I like to use the con­ven­tion <code>project-dev</code>, <code>project-stage</code>, and <code>project-prod</code>. Once you cre­ate your pro­ject in Nanobox, the hard part is over and you can let them do the heavy lift­ing:</p>\n<pre><code>$ nanobox deploy <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">project</span>-dev\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or we can map this to our <span class=\"small-caps\">NPM</span> script:</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">run</span><span class=\"bash\"> deploy:dev  </span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will con­tainer­ize our ap­pli­ca­tion, push it to our droplet, hy­drate the en­tire thing, and serve!

It starts out with a dis­creet name — a clear iden­ti­ﬁer of what this thing is and means. Than this name just sort of … slips away. It be­comes so nor­mal that to name it would seem strange. Its orig­i­nal name does­n’t seem to ﬁt any more, as the name ex­isted in the ﬁrst place to de­mar­cate the new thought from the or­di­nary. And now the new thing is just or­di­nary. Think about Google Maps. It’s just … a map. In 2005, when Google Maps was ﬁrst re­leased, it’s par­tic­u­lar ap­proach to the in­ter­face of a dig­i­tal map was called a<span class=\"push-single\"></span> <span class=\"pull-single\">‘</span>slippy map’. Weird, right?</p>\n<p>This is an in­ter­est­ing phe­nom­e­non around cul­tural ap­proaches to tech­nol­ogy, but not ac­tu­ally what I want to talk about. I want to talk about soft proofs. Soft proofs are an ex­am­ple of this taken to an ex­treme — you use them every day but you have prob­a­bly never heard of them. There is no need for the soft proof to be some­thing other than nor­mal, the soft proof just <em>is</em> nor­mal. But what is a soft proof, and why is it so nor­mal? And why do I want to ex­plore a topic so quo­tid­ian that the word used to mark it as in­ter­est­ing is so faded and worn?</p>\n<p>A soft proof is a way of view­ing an im­age be­fore the im­age has been re­pro­duced me­chan­i­cally. In con­trast to the soft proof is the hard proof: a way of view­ing an im­age im­me­di­ately af­ter it’s been re­pro­duced me­chan­i­cally. Basically, a soft proof is an im­age on a screen that will be sent to a printer. Otherwise known as an im­age. It’s need for a dis­creet name seems so un­nec­es­sary that it seems bizarre to re­fer to all im­ages - even this text as I write it&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;as soft proofs. But that is, in essence, what they are. We see im­ages on our screens that an be re­li­ably turned into im­ages on other peo­ples screens, and even into phys­i­cal im­ages on pa­per.</p>\n<p>The rea­son why this needed a name to de­mar­cate it as spe­cial — dur­ing the ad­vent of the dig­i­tal  — is that this is a re­ally hard prob­lem to solve. There are a range of math­e­mat­i­cal mod­els for ap­proach­ing a rel­a­tively uni­ﬁed the­ory of color and vi­sion, and a wide range of phys­i­cal pieces of ma­chin­ery that are tasked with pro­duc­ing those im­ages — from print­ing presses to mon­i­tors. The act of en­sur­ing an im­age can be pre­dictably re­pro­duced is nec­es­sar­ily an act of trans­la­tion. Translating from this color space to that; from an ad­di­tive color model of a screen to the sub­trac­tive color model of ink and pa­per; ap­prox­i­mat­ing the color of a pa­per stock to be printed on.</p>\n<p>This trans­lat­ing process is done us­ing some­thing called a Color Proﬁle. A Color Proﬁle is a set of rules for en­sur­ing that an im­age cre­ated with red, green, and blue light can be repli­cated on off-white pa­per us­ing cyan, ma­genta, yel­low, or­ange, and green inks. The cur­rent work­ﬂow of dig­i­tal to print is so smooth, so ubiq­ui­tous and mun­dane, as to oc­clude the mas­sive tech­no­log­i­cal feat that it sup­ports it.</p>\n<p>This feat was un­der­taken by a small group of tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies I the early 90s, and they col­lab­o­rated to de­ﬁne a uni­ver­sal stan­dard of how this would work.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The International Color Consortium was formed in 1993 by eight in­dus­try ven­dors in or­der to cre­ate an open, ven­dor-neu­tral color man­age­ment sys­tem which would func­tion trans­par­ently across all op­er­at­ing sys­tems and soft­ware pack­ages.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The eight found­ing mem­bers of the <span class=\"small-caps\">ICC</span> were Adobe, Agfa, Apple, Kodak, Microsoft, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, and Taligent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/icc-profile-negative-tristimulus.html#luther\">- Color Science History and the <span class=\"small-caps\">ICC</span> Proﬁle Speciﬁcations, Elle Stone</a></p>\n<p>The cur­rent, base­line pro­ﬁles built around <span class=\"small-caps\">RGB</span> and <span class=\"small-caps\">CMYK</span> came about with the rise of dig­i­tal im­age-mak­ing, which is the ba­sis of the the cur­rent world around us, a world built on and pred­i­cated by im­ages.</p>\n<p>The dom­i­nant trans­la­tion <em>is</em> dom­i­nant be­cause it — to a large de­gree — works. Creating color pro­ﬁle is re­ally hard, mathy, ph­sysicsy stuff. It’s hard to do your­self. But CMYK/RGB cuts the cor­ners off the world to make it ﬁt into a gamut that can be han­dled. But by ne­ces­sity it’s a com­pro­mise: what col­ors are we not han­dling in or­der to han­dle the max­i­mum num­ber of col­ors? What parts of the color space get left be­hind?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many of these is­sues give me the feel­ing at times of re­luc­tant rather than open co-op­er­a­tion be­tween some of the com­pa­nies that cre­ated this stan­dard. Having said that, there does seem enough in­for­ma­tion in the pub­lic stan­dard (when com­bined with ex­am­in­ing avail­able ex­ist­ing  pro­ﬁles) to ef­fec­tively and ac­cu­rately char­ac­ter­ize color pro­ﬁles of de­vices and color spaces. I could imag­ine there be­ing some poor re­sults at times though, due to some loose­ness in the spec.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://argyllcms.com/icc_problems.html\">—  What’s wrong with the <span class=\"small-caps\">ICC</span> pro­ﬁle for­mat any­way?, Graeme Gill</a></p>\n<p>Its im­por­tant to un­der­stand this com­pro­mise; un­der­stand how it works and what ex­change we’re mak­ing in the process.

We can start by op­er­at­ing out­side the pa­ra­me­ters of the soft proof, rec­og­nize it as a tool to use or not use. The gap be­tween the soft proof &amp; the hard copy is mea­sured in the gap be­tween the tools used to plan &amp; pre­pare ver­sus the tools used to pro­duce, and we can move in to this gap and in­habit it. We can cre­ate work here, and in do­ing so re­claim some of the space that we’ve given away.</p>\n<p>The Risograph, for ex­am­ple, has a tool­chain for soft proof­ing, but the ma­chine— through its high speed &amp; low cost — also opens up the pos­si­bil­ity of de­sign­ing im­ages through it­er­a­tive hard proofs; blend­ing the tech­niques go the mod­ern dig­i­tal print process with the clas­si­cal ana­log ones.</p>\n<p>The web is a strange medium&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a blend­ing of soft and hard spaces.

This is why show­ing comps &amp; wire­frames of web­sites to clients can be so tricky: our cul­ture of im­age cult and tech­no­log­i­cal process can elide the crit­i­cal dif­fer­ences we sense as agents of these sys­tems.</p>\n<p>This is a call for a Marxism of im­age mak­ing — to seize the means of pro­duc­tion. To cre­ate rad­i­cal im­ages &amp; tools that ex­ist in the cor­ners of the gamut and color spaces dis­carded by the soft proof.

We can’t ig­nore the shape of the en­gine or struc­tural code re­quire­ments, al­though our mod­els and paint­ings cer­tainly can. Design is pro­vi­sional un­til the point at which it ex­ists in the world, and when talk­ing about the web even this is­n’t any sort of end­ing. A web­site is its own sort of thing, with its own struc­ture and re­quire­ments that need to be pre­sent and known through­out the en­tire process of de­sign.</p>\n<p>A draw­ing and a web­site will never look the same. This is mostly be­cause a web­site is­n’t sta­tic. Because of this, what a web­site <em>looks like</em> is just a small piece of what a web­site <em>is</em>. A web­site is what it en­ables its users to ac­com­plish, what its de­vel­op­ers have to do to keep it sta­ble and mov­ing for­ward.</p>\n<p>The best way to meet our goals as peo­ple who make good web­sites is to fo­cus less on those draw­ings right away. Instead we should think more about sim­plic­ity and el­e­gance than the de­tail ori­ented per­fec­tion of a jpeg.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong - the jpeg can be im­por­tant. It shows us how we think we can solve our prob­lems, a glimpse of how we want our web­site to looks and feel, and the tone we want to com­mu­ni­cate. Through all this it needs to have to room to change and breath as it comes to life and be­come a real thing. Our draw­ings should not be on the level of<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>what does this look like” but<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>what prob­lem does this solve and how”. At every step in the process we can work to make the real thing bet­ter, to solve new ques­tions that arise as we move through the process of de­sign / de­vel­op­ment&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a process where there is no gap be­tween those two ideas.</p>\n<p>To de­sign a web­site is to de­velop it - and as we de­velop a web­site we are con­stantly mak­ing de­sign de­ci­sions. A de­signer can­not ab­di­cate their re­spon­si­bil­ity to de­sign by say­ing<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>well, my jpeg looked great.” A de­vel­oper can­not ab­di­cate their re­spon­si­bil­ity to a code­base by say­ing<span class=\"push-double\"></span> <span class=\"pull-double\">“</span>well that’s what they wanted in the comp.”</p>\n"},{"meta":{"title":"Building a Client Library for ArcGIS","slug":"building-a-client-library","date":"2015.3.09","description":"<p>Writing a wrap­per client li­brary to smooth out de­sign weird­ness at the <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> level leads to plenty of de­sign think­ing on the way things should be.</p>\n","collection":"texts","timestamp":1425884400000},"content":"<p>This year I built a JavaScript wrap­per for Node and the Browser around the ArcGIS <span class=\"small-caps\">REST</span> <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> to sim­plify work­ing with that plat­form as a de­vel­oper. This was as an ex­er­cise in <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> de­sign, as well as mak­ing a tool that I wanted to use but did­n’t ex­ist yet.

This was the case with the ArcGIS <span class=\"small-caps\">REST</span> <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> that I was run­ning in to. A lot of the de­ci­sions had been made over the course of years, and did­n’t trans­late very smoothly a lan­guage as young as Node.js.</p>\n<p>The ﬁrst step was to ﬁg­ure out what prob­lems I wanted to solve. A lot of my work with Esri <span class=\"small-caps\">PDX</span> has been about con­tent han­dling, and so this is where I started. Reading <em>all</em> the doc to get a big pic­ture of what’s go­ing on with the <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span>, and talk to every­one who’s done work like this be­fore to ﬁg­ure out what prob­lems <em>they</em> needed to solve was the ﬁrst step.

This li­brary is a <span class=\"small-caps\">UI</span> in the most ba­sic sense of the term — it pro­vides an in­ter­face be­tween the de­vel­oper and the servers. That in­ter­face needs to be well de­signed and thought­ful in or­der to make the process as smooth, in­tu­itive, and plea­sur­able as pos­si­ble.</p>\n<p>One of the most im­por­tant parts of the pro­ject is to pro­vide de­vel­op­ers with a way to ac­cess the ArcGIS plat­form with­out need­ing to ar­chi­tect their en­tire ap­pli­ca­tion around opin­ion­ated frame­works (like Dojo, for ex­am­ple). Though the li­brary it­self is writ­ten in <span class=\"small-caps\">ES6</span>, it’s dis­trib­uted as plain, nor­mal <span class=\"small-caps\">ES5</span>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;both as a node pack­age and a pack­aged bun­dle. This means it works both in Node and the browser, and has very few opin­ions on how it in­te­grates with the rest of your app.</p>\n<p>Right now, the li­brary wraps most of the ba­sic plat­form con­tent man­age­ment and in­ter­ac­tions - get­ting and edit­ing users, or­ga­ni­za­tions, and items. The Node ArcGIS Client Library is an open source pro­ject — so it’s scope will in­crease as the com­mu­nity works to ac­com­plish more goals and work­ﬂows.</p>\n<h2>Setting up the client</h2>\n<p>The ﬁrst step in us­ing the li­brary is ini­tial­iz­ing the client with your tar­get por­tal.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-variable\">var</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">ArcGIS</span> = <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-title\">require</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;arcgis&#x27;</span>)</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-variable\">var</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">arcgis</span> = <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-title\">ArcGIS</span>()</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This sets up a de­fault ob­ject for in­ter­act­ing with the <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span>. This de­fault is go­ing to talk to ArcGIS Online as an anony­mous, unau­then­ti­cated user. One can au­then­ti­cate this client ses­sion as a named user by pass­ing in a user to­ken ob­tained from a suc­cess­ful OAuth lo­gin process.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-variable\">var</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">arcgis</span> = <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-title\">Arcgis</span>({\n  <span class=\"hljs-variable\">token</span>: <span class=\"hljs-variable\">namedUserToken</span>\n})</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is­n’t ex­clu­sive to ArcGIS Online. The <span class=\"small-caps\">API</span> for in­ter­act­ing with your or­ga­ni­za­tion’s in­stal­la­tion of Portal or Server is the same.

How can we start to think about maps in a way that bridges this gap? Is there a way we can ap­proach these other, not-a-roadmap-map maps more ef­fec­tively to make them as good as their pa­per-bound cousins?</p>\n<p>To ap­proach this ques­tion from an an­gle, it’s worth tak­ing a mo­ment to think about what a map <em>is</em>. The map is a minia­ture that piv­ots around the body to rep­re­sent the gi­gan­tic enor­mity of the phys­i­cal world. The map shrinks the world down to a place it can be held in the hands and en­tirely seen with the eye. The map con­nects the vast­ness of re­al­ity to the body in way that can be han­dled - both phys­i­cally and men­tally.</p>\n<p>This cre­ates ten­sion with maps on the screen - es­pe­cially the in­ter­net. The screen can <em>not</em> be touched, and the in­ter­net can not be re­lated to the body. Phones and tablets mit­i­gate this by bring­ing the screen closer, and mov­ing to the size of the hand, but the core dif­ﬁ­culty re­mains&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;if a map ex­ists to scale down the enor­mity of the world to the size of the body, the in­ter­net it­self has no bound­aries or edges, and way to re­late the screen to the body.</p>\n<p>Why is this con­nec­tion be­tween world and body im­por­tant? The map pro­vides con­text for un­der­stand­ing world-scale sys­tems and land­scape-scale con­cepts in a hu­man-scale ob­ject. The map is a ty­pol­ogy of com­mu­ni­ca­tion that sits half way be­tween the book and the vi­sual art ob­ject. Both the book and the paint­ing&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;or the print&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;are tech­niques that are used to pro­vide ac­cess to con­cepts and ideas be­yond the scale of a sin­gle in­di­vid­ual. The book can con­tain cen­turies of in­tel­lec­tual thought, the paint­ing can ex­pose feel­ings and emo­tions that touch any num­ber of peo­ple. If the map ex­ists be­tween these two mode of com­mu­ni­ca­tion, that means that it’s goal is to use a vol­ume of thought, of data, of mea­sure­ments to ex­pose a broad, un­der­ly­ing con­cept. This can be an en­vi­ron­men­tal truth (or the sup­po­si­tion of one) or a so­ci­etal in­sight.</p>\n<p>The map does this through a very spe­ciﬁc set of vi­sual de­sign tools with for­mal qual­i­ties that lend them­selves to the prob­lem at hand. These for­mal­i­ties are partly de­ﬁned and struc­tured by the tech­nolo­gies be­hind the pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­b­u­tion of the map.</p>\n<p>The ﬁrst maps where hand drawn, and cor­re­spond­ingly have at­trib­utes of other hand-made vi­sual works. With the ad­vent of print­ing, maps started to be carved into wood, and du­pli­cated. After wood, they came to etch­ing, and af­ter that lith­o­g­ra­phy. In each of the print tech­niques, cer­tain marks are fa­vored and made pos­si­ble through the medium of the ma­trix it­self. Shared in all the print tech­niques, how­ever, is the con­cept of plates&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;in­di­vid­ual drawn lay­ers for dif­fer­ent col­ors. Equating in­di­vid­ual plates to in­di­vid­ual col­ors to in­di­vid­ual <em>ty­po­log­i­cal con­cepts</em> be­ing shown on the map is a big rea­son why printed maps are so good.</p>\n<p>The care­ful and de­lib­er­ate ap­pli­ca­tion of the maps for­mal char­ac­ter­is­tics to di­rectly ad­dress the ideas and con­cepts to be com­mu­ni­cated, the ad­dress the <em>use</em> of the map is what makes a map good.</p>\n<p>On the in­ter­net, we make maps dif­fer­ently. <span class=\"small-caps\">GIS</span> data sets mean that maps can be made through math­e­mat­i­cal and an­a­lytic tools&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;com­par­ing sets of data, and cre­at­ing new sets of data to an­swer ques­tions. A ro­bust and open set of pub­lic data means that there are map mak­ing tools which pro­vide ways to style and com­bine ex­ist­ing con­tent.</p>\n<p>These tech­niques uti­lize a rel­a­tively sta­tic map that pur­ports to use­fully de­scribe the en­tire ge­og­ra­phy of the planet. All of the maps made are in­tended to sit within larger ap­pli­ca­tion, it­self de­signed to solve a prob­lem.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, these maps fail to pro­vide mean­ing­ful con­nec­tion to the con­cepts pro­vided - they lose the es­sen­tial as­pect of the map that join world-to-hu­man scales, in­stead op­er­at­ing at the world-to-world level. The end­less map of the in­ter­net is it­self in­com­pre­hen­si­ble to the body. The maps of the in­ter­net are si­mul­ta­ne­ously too broad and too sim­ple, pro­vid­ing too much and too lit­tle.

We need pix­els. And that’s true, we do need pix­els. Let’s re­frame these prin­ci­ples:</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img class=\"figure-image lazyload\" src=\"/180x180/figure-three.png\" data-optimumx=\"1.6\" data-src=\"/{width}x5000/figure-three.png\" data-sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"Aesthetic, Conceptual, Material\">\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<p>Thinking about our sub­strate, our ma­te­ri­als are our de­vices, which ren­der with pix­els.</p>\n<h2>But our ma­te­ri­als change -</h2>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img class=\"figure-image lazyload\" src=\"/180x180/figure-four.png\" data-optimumx=\"1.6\" data-src=\"/{width}x5000/figure-four.png\" data-sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"Aesthetic, Conceptual, Material\">\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<p>Our de­vices get more and more pixel den­sity, their pro­por­tions change, tech­nol­ogy im­proves, <span class=\"small-caps\">CSS</span> ab­stracts a<span class=\"push-single\"></span> <span class=\"pull-single\">‘</span>pixel’ of its own, Android ex­ists, and all of a sud­den our ma­te­ri­als get away from us and fo­cus­ing on the pixel gives us an aneurysm.</p>\n<p>But don’t worry, be­cause:</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img class=\"figure-image lazyload\" src=\"/180x180/figure-one.png\" data-optimumx=\"1.6\" data-src=\"/{width}x5000/figure-one.png\" data-sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"Pixels Don't Matter\">\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<h2>We still have two other lay­ers to work through.</h2>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img class=\"figure-image lazyload\" src=\"/180x180/figure-five.png\" data-optimumx=\"1.6\" data-src=\"/{width}x5000/figure-five.png\" data-sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"Pixels Don't Matter\">\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  \nOur ma­te­ri­als don’t dic­tate our aes­thet­ics nor or con­cept, but ma­te­ri­als do in­form our de­ci­sions. So think about pix­els, but put them in the proper place - as the sub­strate of our work.</p>\n<h2>Measurement sys­tems are ab­stract ideas -</h2>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img class=\"figure-image lazyload\" src=\"/180x180/figure-six.png\" data-optimumx=\"1.6\" data-src=\"/{width}x5000/figure-six.png\" data-sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"measure\">\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  \nAn inch is not a thing, a foot is not a thing. The pixel is a ph­sy­i­cal thing, and as a phys­i­cal thing we’ve seen that it’s prone to change.</p>\n<h2>The pixel is a ter­ri­ble way to mea­sure things.</h2>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img class=\"figure-image lazyload\" src=\"/180x180/figure-seven.png\" data-optimumx=\"1.6\" data-src=\"/{width}x5000/figure-seven.png\" data-sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"pixel\">\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  \nSo use an­other sys­tem to mea­sure, any other sys­tem. The ra­tios, the pro­por­tions, the re­la­tion­ships and the hi­er­ar­chies are im­por­tant. That’s where we do our work as de­sign­ers.</p>\n<p>So don’t stress pix­els. Spare them a thought when you get started, and know that at some point in the process they’ll make them­selves ap­par­ent, and will need to be ad­dressed. But the pix­els will let you know, and when you need to deal with them they’ll be there.</p>\n<h2>Show Time</h2>\n<p>These are some comps for the <a href=\"/projects/mapattack\">MapAttack</a> mo­bile app.</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img class=\"figure-image lazyload\" src=\"/180x180/figure-eight.png\" data-optimumx=\"1.6\" data-src=\"/{width}x5000/figure-eight.png\" data-sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"Mapattack Comps\">\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<p>Every el­e­ment is spec­i­ﬁed by ex­act pixel counts. The type­faces are de­ﬁned, the mar­gins, the padding, and the bor­der strokes are each pre­cisely de­ter­mined and la­beled.\nDon’t get the wrong idea - this is­n’t my hypocrisy you’re see­ing. These de­signs did­n’t <em>start</em> life here, this is just where they ended up.</p>\n<p>Before hand­ing off my de­sign, I ba­si­cally ran pre-press on it. Our de­vel­op­ers do need pix­els - they need these val­ues. They need them for ex­e­cu­tion and pro­duc­tion. So we, as their de­sign­ers, need to give them pix­els. But we also need to give them more than just that.</p>\n<p>\n    <figure class=\"figure\">\n      <picture>\n        <img class=\"figure-image lazyload\" src=\"/180x180/figure-nine.png\" data-optimumx=\"1.6\" data-src=\"/{width}x5000/figure-nine.png\" data-sizes=\"auto\" alt=\"Mapattack Comps Closeup\">\n      </picture>\n    </figure>\n  </p>\n<p>We need to give them the blue­prints for how we <em>think</em> about the de­sign. That means show­ing what’s pro­por­tional as pro­por­tion, show­ing what’s ﬂuid as ﬂuid. This gives our sta­tic comps the life they need to work for a huge range of de­vices.</p>\n<h2>Love the Pixel, let it be a Pixel.</h2>\n<p>Letting Pixels be beau­ti­ful, blocky, phys­i­cal lit­tle things means us­ing them to ren­der our de­signs, not dic­tate them. It means us­ing ac­tual mea­sure­ment sys­tems to mea­sure. And more im­por­tantly, it gives us a way to un­der­stand our lay­out bet­ter, to ar­rive at more con­sid­ered de­signs, and to un­der­stand our de­signs as they live on ac­tual hard­ware in the ac­tual world.</p>\n"}]
