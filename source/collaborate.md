I am a Creative Technologist and Developer with a background in [design](http://nikolas.ws/texts/how-to-design-while-developing/) and the [fine arts](http://department.press/). Over the past [9 years](http://nikolas.ws/cv) I've excelled in R&D environments and creative studios.

I'm currently seeking a role as a Lead Developer as part of a team of driven, thoughtful, and kind humans. If you think I would be a good fit for your company, or know someone I should talk to, please reach out at <a href="mailto:studio@nikolas.ws">studio@nikolas.ws</a>

üîÆ My technical skillset includes production experience with contemporary JavaScript frameworks [like React](https://svelte.technology/), e-commerce development, CSS & Systemic SCSS architecture, semantic HTML, WCAAG and 508 accessibility, [web GIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/) and [web mapping tools](https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/), development environment [automation](http://paulcpederson.com/articles/npm-run/), Git best practices, Node JS development, headless CMS's, [real-time applications](http://joseki.party/), and rapid & flexible [prototyping](https://fuzzco-pica.glitch.me/index.html).

üõ†Ô∏è At Fuzzco I built some [awesome](https://eastfork.com/) [ecommerce](https://hanselfrombasel.com/) projects, along with [beautiful](https://evidation.com/) and [experimental](https://tobacapital.wpengine.com/) front end projects. To facilitate the fast pace of the studio, I built [turn-key project scaffolds](https://github.com/fuzzco/nanobox-wordpress) to solve common development problems. 

üöö I've designed and built systems for building systems, including modernizing and [containerizing](https://nanobox.io/) Dev Ops workflows and introducing and maintaining ergonomic best practices for development teams. These systems reduced project budgets by up to 20% on average.

üèµ Several of the systems I've built are [design systems](http://esri.github.io/calcite-web/) and [toolkits](https://github.com/nikolaswise?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=modular&type=&language=). Through typographic, grid layout, and UI pattern systems, I've built projects that allow rapid development of world-class designs.

‚ö° With my background in design and visual critique, I have a strong understanding of my colleagues on design teams. I value working closely with designers, and helping developers open up possibilities to the design process.

üí™ I've mentored developers in my community, and teach [workshops](http://j608.nikolas.ws/#1) to students at the University of Oregon. I've given [talks](https://vimeo.com/291928620) to conferences and classroom. I'm really proud of the team of two [talented](http://www.daringhue.com/) [developers](http://ebanach.com/) I built at Fuzzco, and value mentorship as a guiding principle of my career.

üî≠ I'm looking for a new team that values [multidisciplinary collaboration](http://nikolas.ws/texts/pixels-dont-matter/), and the value that thoughtful design can bring to [ethical technology](http://nikolas.ws/texts/soft-proof/). My ideal team is diverse, passionate, and understands the value of a work/life balance.
