I am a Creative Technologist and Developer with a background in [design](http://nikolas.ws/texts/how-to-design-while-developing/) and the [fine arts](http://department.press/). Over the past [9 years](http://nikolas.ws/cv) I've excelled in R&D environments and creative studios.

If you think I would be a good fit for your company, or know someone I should talk to, please reach out at <a href="mailto:studio@nikolas.ws">studio@nikolas.ws</a>


üîÆ My technical skillset includes production experience with contemporary JavaScript frameworks [like React](https://svelte.technology/), e-commerce development, CSS & Systemic SCSS architecture, samantic and valid HTML, WCAAG and 508 accessibillity, Web GIS and Web Mapping tools, development environment automation, Git best practices, Node JS development, headless CMS's, real-time applications, and rapid & flexible prototyping.

üõ†Ô∏è At Fuzzco I built some [awesome](https://eastfork.com/) [ecommerce](https://hanselfrombasel.com/) projects, along with [beautiful](https://evidation.com/) and [experimental](https://tobacapital.wpengine.com/) front end projects. I set up systems for making websites that cut project budgets by 20% on average.

üöö I've designed and built systems for building systems, including modernizing and containerizing Dev Ops workflows and introducing and maintaining ergonominc best practices for development teams.

üèµ Several of the systems I've built are [design systems]() and [toolkits](). Through typogrphic, grid layout, and UI pattern systems, I've built projects that allow rapid development of world-class designs.

‚ö°With my background in design and visual critique, I have a strong understanding of my collegues on design teams. I value working closely with designers, and helping developers open up possibillities to the design process.

üí™ I've mentored developers in my community, and taught workshops to students at the University of Oregon. I'm really proud of the team of two [talented](http://www.daringhue.com/) [developers](http://ebanach.com/) I built at Fuzzco, and value mentorship as a guiding principle of my career.

üî≠ I'm looking for a new team that values [multidisciplinary collaboration](http://nikolas.ws/texts/pixels-dont-matter/), and the value that thoughtful design can bring to [ethical technology](http://nikolas.ws/texts/soft-proof/).
