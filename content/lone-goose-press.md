What it is:
A catalog and ecommerce website for Euegene based letterpress printer Sandy Tilcock.

What it does:
Presents the rang of work undertaken by the press, along with the philosophy and working principles of Tilcock. Demonstrates work samples, and provides a marketplace to purchase fine art.

Why we did it:
lone goose press' previous website was not up to date with the latest work, had to commerce, and was unwieldy to update.

Why it's interesting:
The project was an opportunity to blend techniques of design for web with the analog and hand-set design processes that Sandy specializes in, an exercise in translating fine print designs for web, maintaining the integrity of the design through the challenges of the new medium.
