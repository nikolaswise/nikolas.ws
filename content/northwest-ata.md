description: Working with an established NYC Bookkeeper to create a brand new business identity and entity in Portland, Oregon. This project was a full business bootstrap; including working with a brand voice developer, copywriter, and illustrator. I worked to create a brand identity, visual language system, and development framework. I designed and produced physical ephemera, and a landing page that integrated with existing business systems.
