I decided it was about time to just write this down somewhere I can always find it. Below is the recipe for old Shanghai style eggnog, or as I refer to it: _High Octane Nogahol_. I tend to omit the optional ingredients at the end, and just serve the 'nog without the additional fluff.

This recipe is 8:5 dairy:alchohol, with 8 parts bourbon to 1 part brandy or cognac, and 1 part rum.

## Ingredients

12 large eggs
2 cups sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1 quart whole milk
1 liter bourbon
1/2 cup dark rum
1/2 cup cognac or brandy

## Instructions

1. Whisk 12 egg yolks with sugar.

2. Add the cream, milk, bourbon, rum, and cognac.

3. Age. Or don't!

5. Serve with a little nutmeg grated on top.
