I decided it was about time to just right this down somewhere I can always find it. Below is the recipe for old Shanghai style eggnog, or as I refer to it: _High Octane Nogahol_. I tend to omit the optional ingredients at the end, and just serve the 'nog without the additional fluff.

This recipe is 8:5 dairy:alchohol, with 8 parts bourbon to 1 part brandy and 1 part rum.

## Ingredients

12 each Eggs large
2 cups Granulated sugar
1 cup Heavy cream
1 quart Whole milk (4 cups)
1 liter Bourbon (Jim Beam), about 4 cups
1/2 cup Myer's Dark Rum
1/2 cup Cognac good quality, use up to 1 cup
1 pinch Kosher Salt
1 whole Nutmeg
10 each Egg whites (optional)
1 1/2 cups Heavy cream (optional)

## Instructions

1. Separate the 12 eggs. Combine the yolks and sugar in a large mixing bowl, and whisk until well blended and creamy. (Reserve the egg whites for another use).

2. Add the cream, milk, bourbon, rum, cognac (use the good stuff), and a pinch of salt.

3. Bottle it right away and refrigerate it until it's ready. An old liquor bottle works great, as do 22-ounce bail-top bottles, available in brewing supply stores. (My grandfather keeps the eggnog in the garage for three weeks, stirring occasionally, then bottles it... but aging in the garage is not recommended because the temperature can fluctuate.)

4. It's traditional to wrap the bottle in aluminum foil, together with a fresh whole nut of nutmeg tucked into the foil for grating later. Keep refrigerated for at least 3 weeks, or up to a year if you can.

5. I serve aged eggnog on the rocks with some freshly grated nutmeg on top. If you want to serve the eggnog in the traditional way, pour it into a punch bowl. In separate bowls, whip the 10 egg whites and 1 1/2 cups heavy cream to soft peaks and fold them into the eggnog. Serve in punch cups, garnished with freshly grated nutmeg.
