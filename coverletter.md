Hello Smugmug!

My name is Nikolas Wise â€” I am a creative technologist and developer based in Portland Oregon with a background in design and the fine arts.

My technical experience is strongly rooted in front end development, with significant experience in development operations and writing Node.js server-side code. My background includes building applications with both vanilla ES6 and contemporary JavaScript frameworks, systemic CSS and SCSS architectures, and maintaining accessibility and graceful degradation of project across legacy browsers, 

With Fuzzco, I recently lead and mentored a team of developers, and focused on implementing new workflows that helpded us meet deadlines, accomplish team goals, and elevate best practices. These systemic changes have reduced our project budgets by nearly 20% on average, while supporting the professional growth and development of my team.

As a developer and designer at Esri, I built and maintained an open-source design system, a client library, and a developer-facing software-as-a-service app. The goal for each of these projects is to help a global community of developers engage with Esri's mapping tools and Geographic Information Systems platform. At Esri, I was responsible for developing products that implemented design best practices for graceful and clear UI and UX. Many of these design patterns became a part of the official Esri design system.

As a developer with SmugMug, I'm looking forward to applying my broad skillset and expertise in studio settings to SmugMugs' in-house team. I'm excited about the opportunity to build something beautiful, and am very much looking forward to talking further with your team!

Thank you,  
Nikolas Wise
