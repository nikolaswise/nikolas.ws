Hello!

My name is Nikolas Wise, and I am interested in applying for the Learning Engineer position. I've been developing web projects for nearly 10 years, and Git and Github has been a central part of my experience and growth as a developer. The opportunity to join the team responsible for helping others grow is incredibly exciting to me!

My entire career has been driven by the desire to create excellent things. I got my start as a designer, but quickly found that the things I wanted to make were websites and digital products. The idea that creative decisions, understanding, and doing are all connected has always been present in my artistic practice, and this ethos led me to web development. If the things I want to make are on the internet, I needed to make them myself in order to best understand how to make things on the internet!

As my understanding of development grew — both through my own independent learning and an incredible array of peers and mentors — so did my desire to push the boundaries of what I could do. This has led me through nearly the entire range of what's possible on the internet — grounded in Node and Javascript. Throughout this process, I have always kept my ethic of rigorous critique cultivated by the arts and an awareness of effective, excellent design that drives my desire to create.

I've had the opportunity to host lectures, workshops, and teach the fundamentals of web design and development at a post-graduate level. Teaching has always been a major part of my career trajectory. In my current role as Director of Web Development (think Director of Technology except I don't have to fix the printer) I am actively engaged in the professional development of both the developers on my team and the designers that we work with.

As a product designer & developer at Esri's Portland Research & Development office, one of my primary responsibilities was researching the entire ecosystem of mapping and geographic data API's — including Esri's own. In this role I worked to improve and expand Esri's developer experience by understanding contemporary best practices in application design. My team was responsible for for creation, development, and growth of the ArcGIS for Developers aspect of Esri's platform, working to educate and provide resources for both existing users and make the platform enticing  for the next wave of companies and engineers. This project was successful enough that we were asked to bring the same approach to Esri's flagship web product, ArcGIS Online.

Since moving to the Design Studio side of the internet two years ago — both running my own practice and leading the team at Fuzzco — my primary goal is to work within the constraints of the client/studio system to create the highest quality, most efficient solutions possible. Focusing on goals — both business and design — maximizing resources, and finding efficiencies has been the name of the game. This work has been fast-moving, and broad in its scope. From marketing sites to products to full stack e-commerce solutions, I've been responsible for researching, proposing, and developing integrations, work flows, and third party systems to meet precise, highly sensitive business use cases.

I am really excited to bring my perspective, experience, and dedication to teaching & learning to the Learning Lab team at Github.

Thank you,
Nikolas
